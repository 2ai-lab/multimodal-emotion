Ses01F_script03_1_F008, Hmm.  The pity is that one can't stay happy.,0
Ses05F_impro03_M049, So I was one of the first ones? That makes me feel so important.,0
Ses01F_script03_1_F009, It's true.  I think the whole thing's a cruel joke.,0
Ses05M_script01_3_F001, It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,0
Ses05F_impro07_M033, That's a good idea.,0

Ses04M_impro07_M016, So um,0
Ses05F_script03_1_M023," I don't mind what you do, see, you could paint your body green all over and dance naked through the Place Vendome and run off with every man in the world.  And I shan't say a word as long as I know that you love me best.",0
Ses03F_script03_1_M022, Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,0

Ses04F_script03_2_F006, It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,0

Ses01F_script03_1_F030, [LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.,0
Ses01M_script03_1_F028," Oh, thank you darling.",0
Ses05F_script03_1_M008," [LAUGHTER] Oh, the things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?",0
Ses04F_impro03_F024, who- Who's getting married though?,0
Ses01F_script03_1_M026," Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.",0
Ses01M_impro07_M014, Yeah. I think it's in the afternoon 'cause I mean can't be too early 'cause then you can't see the ball.,0
Ses04M_impro03_M009," But uh- no, I mean, you know.  You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of",0
Ses05F_impro03_F011, Sorry.,0
Ses03F_impro03_M005, yeah [LAUGHTER],0
Ses04F_script03_1_M035, We were very much younger then.,0
Ses03M_impro07_F010, Oh man.,0
Ses02M_impro03_M012, I-I did.,0
Ses02F_impro03_F026," Yeah, it's pretty good.",0
Ses01F_script02_2_M047, Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?,0
Ses03F_impro06_F000, Okay.,0
Ses02M_impro07_F009," Yeah, totally.",0
Ses05M_impro07_M038," That helps, right?  Get some academic scholarships. And uh-",0
Ses03F_script03_1_M031," Oh, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",0
Ses03M_impro03_M032," Yeah, she is good-looking.",0
Ses05M_script02_2_F034," Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.",0
Ses03M_impro02_F001," How's it- going?  Oh I'm so tired.  Oh, I just woke up. Mmm.",0
Ses05F_impro03_F030," Knowing the neighborhood.  Yeah, it's pretty bizarre.",0
Ses05F_impro03_F026, Yeah.,0
Ses02M_impro07_M008," Yeah. I know, I know.",0
Ses04M_impro03_M027," Exactly, exactly, exactly.  So--",0
Ses02M_impro07_M012," I know, I know, yea. It'll be interesting you know, I've never -- I mean getting out of Vegas and everything but LA",0
Ses05M_script03_1_M024," I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.",0
Ses04F_impro03_F039, Well right but you can help.,0
Ses03F_impro07_F001," Uh-, So I got some good news.",0
Ses01M_script03_2_M000, [LAUGHTER],0
Ses05F_impro03_F025, He's from Chicago as well.,0
Ses04F_script03_1_F003, Now and always sweet.,0
Ses04F_impro07_F036, [LAUGHTER],0
Ses03M_script02_1_M031, And last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didn't even notice it until we got in the car.,0
Ses02F_script01_3_F014, Every day since.,0
Ses04F_script01_3_F002, You know it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,0
Ses01M_impro07_M025, But they got to like drive around in a bus--that would suck.,0
Ses03F_impro03_F023," Oh, maybe. I don't know. I've been there so many times. I think it's--we're going to get married in Spain and then we're going to get married here.",0
Ses02M_impro08_F014, -But online is faster I can do that.,0
Ses02F_script01_3_F013, You started to write me and--,0
Ses02M_script03_1_M004, I don't care then.,0
Ses01F_script03_2_M000, We were very much younger then.,0
Ses01M_script03_1_M028," Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER]",0
Ses04M_impro07_M022," 'Cause, you know, it's like you get to know a lot of people in the dorms and.",0
Ses02F_impro07_F027, And you'll be like...,0
Ses02F_impro07_M014, That's great.,0
Ses04F_impro03_M011," Well no, I am- I'm trying to be positive",0
Ses04M_impro03_M006," She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so...",0
Ses04F_impro08_F000, Hello.  Thank you for calling Dell Taco Corporate.  Can I help you?,0
Ses04F_script03_1_F020," Elliott, worms don't pop.",0
Ses04M_impro03_M018," It'll be kind of small, but not, you know, not tiny, you know.  I want to have, you know, as many people as we can afford to fly out to Hawaii and put up there for--",0
Ses03M_script02_2_F046, No I'm beginning to think you might be right.,0
Ses04F_impro03_F015, plan everything.  So then you can make sure that no one gets attacked by bears.,0
Ses01M_script02_2_F020, We thought I was pregnant we had this bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance so we took off our shoes.,0
Ses05M_impro07_M008," Oh, of course.  No.  I didn't know it was that tough.  I'm just happy that I made it.",0
Ses04M_impro07_M023, Well I'll have flip flops for that.  That's not  some- It's not a problem.,0
Ses04M_script03_2_F002," How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",0
Ses01F_script03_1_F004, It had to happen sooner or later.,0
Ses01M_script03_1_F009, [LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey.,0
Ses04M_script02_2_M039," Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.",0
Ses04F_impro03_F027, It's not your wedding. You can-,0
Ses05F_impro03_M063, just being polite now,0
Ses03M_script02_2_F042, Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.,0
Ses05F_script02_2_M041, Or not.,0
Ses01F_impro06_F017, It was hot.[LIPSMACK],0
Ses04M_impro07_F035, I'm just -- I'm watching your back.,0
Ses04M_script01_3_M009, I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.  I'm embarrassing you.,0
Ses03M_impro03_M012, Sara and I--,0
Ses01M_script02_2_M005, It certainly is not.  It's like slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,0
Ses01M_script03_1_M041, We were very much younger then.,0
Ses02F_script01_3_F017, Not like that you're not.,0
Ses04F_impro03_F046, What about Kathy?  I mean you guys have been dating for a while.,0
Ses05F_impro07_M027," Uh huh, it will be awesome.",0
Ses03M_script03_1_F008, What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy.,0
Ses02F_impro03_M020," Yeah, I'd love to be in that same situation some day, but, wow- so-",0
Ses04F_impro03_F051, [LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.,0
Ses03M_impro03_F027, How long have you guys been going out?,0
Ses04F_impro03_F021, It's a wedding.,0
Ses05F_script03_1_F006, Behave exquisitely.,0
Ses02F_script01_3_F002," You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.",0
Ses01F_script03_1_F026, It went on intermittently for days.,0
Ses05F_impro03_F052," Yeah, I think so.  I mean, not for a while.",0
Ses05F_impro03_F010," I know, right. What'd we say, when we were thirty nine?",0
Ses05M_script03_1_F014," Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",0
Ses03M_script03_1_M010," Oh, darling.  Don't say that.",0
Ses01F_impro07_F008," Umm. It's...It's uhh...It's Critical Studies. It's a really prestigious program, so they say.",0
Ses04M_script03_1_F022, Which particular one?,0
Ses04M_script01_3_F002," No, not sorry, but I'm not going to stay.",0
Ses04F_impro07_F019, Yeah.,0
Ses01F_script02_2_M024, Do you want to take off your shoes?,0
Ses04F_impro03_M022, So we're going to go greens and browns.,0
Ses05F_script01_3_M018, I kissed you.,0
Ses03F_impro07_F023," Oh man, I'm so excited. So much to do.",0
Ses04M_script01_3_M014, You felt something that far back?,0
Ses02M_impro03_F019," Yea, totally. So when is it going to happen?",0
Ses04F_impro03_F041, Ha ha.,0
Ses04M_impro03_F022, She's going to let you have say in the wedding choices?  That's pretty impressive. Very forward-thinking woman. [LAUGHTER],0
Ses02M_impro03_M007," Well, yes, I wanted it you know I guess sort of as a surprise for everyone so",0
Ses05F_impro07_F026, oh yeah.,0
Ses03M_impro03_M014, She wanted...she always wants something spontaneous.,0
Ses03F_script01_3_M009," I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.",0
Ses05M_script03_1_M032, I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],0
Ses02F_impro08_M014," All right, Sure.  A yeah, that- that'd be good.",0
Ses04F_script02_2_F020," and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me",0
Ses02F_impro07_M012, Yeah. Hey. Prestigious school.,0
Ses04F_impro03_F029," You can't ruin my mood today.  If you want to wear a brown tux, you go ahead and wear a brown tux",0
Ses02M_impro07_F020," Okay. They have a lot of good schools, right?",0
Ses03F_impro07_F035," [LAUGHTER]. Oh, Joe, I'm so happy.",0
Ses02M_impro03_F018, Are your parents excited or...?,0
Ses01M_script02_2_F023," Dancing on the beach barefoot, drinking champagne from the bottle.",0
Ses03M_script03_1_M019," Well, it depends on how well we've played.",0
Ses05M_impro03_F009," No, it's totally original, though.",0
Ses02M_impro07_F013," Oh, yay. Thank you. [LAUGHTER].",0
Ses05F_script01_3_F002, It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.,0
Ses02F_impro03_F002, Don't look at my left hand.,0
Ses04M_script03_1_M019," No, no, it isn't.  Death's very laughable; such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.",0
Ses05F_impro03_M015," Nice, you love the jazz.",0
Ses02M_impro07_M001, Yeah. And guess who accepted me?,0
Ses04F_impro03_M005," I'm invited, right.",0
Ses03M_script02_1_M011, Was it a full moon last year when they were running?  I can't remember.  Do you remember?,0
Ses02M_impro07_M009, it was you know I wasn't too sure I mean you know it was kind of last minute for like the application,0
Ses01M_script03_1_M004, I don't care then.,0
Ses04M_impro03_M029, All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.,0
Ses01M_script03_1_M033, Do you remember that row we did have in Venice?,0
Ses02M_script01_3_M016," Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-",0
Ses04F_script03_1_M019, It all depends on how well we've played.,0
Ses04M_script03_2_M002, I shall never forget his face.,0
Ses01F_script02_2_M023, Do you want me to go get some champagne?,0
Ses04F_script01_3_M009," Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",0
Ses02F_script02_2_F036," Oh, for heaven sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",0
Ses05F_script03_1_M019," No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.",0
Ses03M_script01_1_F045, I don't understand you do I?,1
Ses05M_script01_1b_M005," Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",1
Ses02M_impro02_F006, I hope so.,1
Ses02F_script01_3_M024," Well, I lost them.",1
Ses05M_impro06_M008, And he's gone now and I  -- I just can't believe it.,1
Ses01M_script02_2_M043, Maybe if you were with somebody else too?,1
Ses02M_script01_3_F025, Do you still feel that way?,1
Ses05F_script03_1_F009," Well, it's true.",1
Ses01M_script01_3_M035, You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...,1
Ses04F_script01_1_F033, Just give it some more thought.,1
Ses05F_impro06_F023," really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped.",1
Ses02F_impro02_F010," Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it.",1
Ses04F_script01_3_M039," I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",1
Ses03M_impro02_F019, You could.  You really could.  You could-- --get into another line of work.  I could start working after Anna's born?,1
Ses05F_impro06_M008, Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him?,1
Ses03F_impro06_F005," They thought he got--would get better and he did, and then it just- things turned bad.",1
Ses02F_script01_1_F001," How could he see it?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",1
Ses03F_impro02_F032, I will come back.,1
Ses01M_script01_1_M026, So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M022, What if you don't come back?,1
Ses05F_impro02_F006, Iraq.,1
Ses01M_impro02_M019, Do promise me you're going to take a lot of pictures.,1
Ses03M_script01_1_M002, About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_M008," Being dishonest with him.  I mean, that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",1
Ses05M_script01_1_M003," I don't know, but after it broke he ran back inside and started crying in the kitchen.",1
Ses03F_impro06_F004," he had cancer, you know?",1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F004, Did you talk to him?,1
Ses01M_impro06_M002, You didn't even hear?,1
Ses02F_impro04_F006," Yeah, but maybe--if just because it's competitive, like maybe I'm just not good enough.  Maybe the level is here and I'm here and there's just no way I'm ever gonna do that--",1
Ses03M_impro06_F005, I'm so sorry.,1
Ses03F_impro06_F035, I loved him so much.,1
Ses01M_script01_1_M025," Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  However from her letters I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",1
Ses03M_script01_3_M037," And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.",1
Ses03F_script03_1_F014," Oh dear, well, shall we want that?",1
Ses01M_script02_2_F035," I know that Augie, I really do.",1
Ses04M_impro06_M003, Yeah.,1
Ses04M_script01_3_F010, I almost got married two years ago.,1
Ses04M_impro06_M005, I just -- it's just not fair.,1
Ses03F_script02_2_F027, No.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_M024," No, nothing, nothing like that.",1
Ses05M_impro06_M004," You know, he was gonna, and we -- all the way up to the end we were just talking about how- you know all the stuff we were gonna do and, you know.  When he finally kicked this stupid cancer, you know, and we were gonna --",1
Ses04F_script01_3_M033, They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M023, It's so fucked up.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M009, God.,1
Ses02M_impro06_M006," God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go",1
Ses04F_script01_1_M004," No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.",1
Ses05F_impro02_M028," I don't know.  It's not me, so I'm the one who has to stay here.  I'm the one who has to take care of them, and I don't have-I don't have anybody else.  You're all I have.",1
Ses05M_impro06_M017," No, you're right.  I don't.  You're right.",1
Ses02M_script03_1_M009, Oh darling don't say that.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_M029," They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",1
Ses03F_script01_3_M040," And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.",1
Ses02M_script02_2_M036, I'm doing the best I can.,1
Ses01M_impro02_F012, How do you know?,1
Ses04F_impro06_F002," I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know?",1
Ses04F_impro02_M013, Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't-,1
Ses01M_script01_1_F033, Give it some more thought.,1
Ses02M_script01_1_M004, No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.,1
Ses02F_script02_2_F020, I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,1
Ses04M_impro06_F004," But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --",1
Ses04F_impro02_F017, Thanks that helps.,1
Ses04M_script01_3_M031, a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_F025," Tell me what's wrong.  I mean, even in your letters you seemed ashamed.",1
Ses04F_script02_2_F037," I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",1
Ses02M_script01_1_F013, To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you?,1
Ses02M_impro06_F009," She really cared about you, you know.",1
Ses03M_impro02_M019, You know I can't say no.,1
Ses02M_impro02_M008," I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do.",1
Ses02F_script01_1_M041, Then help me stay here.,1
Ses01F_impro06_F005, I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M023, A lot of people loved him.,1
Ses05M_script02_2_M031," Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?",1
Ses05F_impro02_F020, You can't what?,1
Ses04F_impro02_M010, You're a smart person.  There are other things you can do.,1
Ses01M_script01_3_F022, Wouldn't work like this.,1
Ses05M_script01_3_M019, Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.,1
Ses03M_impro02_F013, Do this whole thing by myself?,1
Ses02F_script01_3_M020, No.  Nothing like that.,1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F010," To you it is and to me, but not to him.",1
Ses01M_script02_2_M045, Yeah?,1
Ses05F_impro02_F021, I don't think there's anything we can do.,1
Ses05F_script02_2_F030," For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.",1
Ses05M_impro06_M014," You always think, you know when you were- you know when you were a little kid and you think something is gonna happen, like, it will all be better when I am older, you know?",1
Ses03F_impro06_M002," I didn't know him, Tricia, but uh- I heard that he was a great man.",1
Ses04F_script01_3_M005, The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so but they take it for granted that we're all set.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_F005, First of all your mother so much as told me to go.,1
Ses02M_impro02_F010," I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get",1
Ses03M_impro02_M028, Well that's the kind of work I'm in honey.,1
Ses04F_impro06_F005," He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do.  You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that.",1
Ses05M_script01_1_F004, Did you talk to him?,1
Ses02M_impro06_F002," It doesn't make any easier, yes.",1
Ses04M_impro06_F000," Hey, how you doing?",1
Ses03F_impro02_F011, It's going- It's going to be probably in about three weeks.,1
Ses03M_impro02_F011, I don't care about the money.,1
Ses03F_impro06_F028, They talked about getting married and--,1
Ses04F_impro02_F021, You know- you know how this works.  I have to go.,1
Ses02M_impro06_F003," Oh, man. I'm so sorry.",1
Ses02F_impro04_F016," I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning.",1
Ses01M_impro02_M021, I just wish there was something I could do.,1
Ses01F_script02_2_F024, No.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_F019," Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",1
Ses03M_script01_3_M034," It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?",1
Ses05F_script01_1_M011," Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?",1
Ses02F_script01_1_M009, You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,1
Ses03F_impro06_M011," Yeah, but you were there all the hospital days. By his bed-",1
Ses02M_impro06_F011, Yeah.,1
Ses04M_impro06_F005, --it doesn't really do anything.  But--,1
Ses03F_impro06_F027, Kelly. Kelly Uveny.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_F017," I've got an idea, but what's the story?",1
Ses01F_impro06_F008, So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-,1
Ses02M_impro06_M016," I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it",1
Ses04M_script01_2_F019, Just don't stop believing.,1
Ses02F_impro06_F002," It seemed like he had a little bit longer.  Like just last week, he was doing was so well.",1
Ses01M_impro06_F022, MMhmm.,1
Ses02F_impro02_M002," But, I'm--I'm nothing--I'm nothing without you here.  Maybe we can--we can get out of this somehow.",1
Ses04F_script01_3_M028, Well I lost them.,1
Ses05M_script01_1b_M001, He was out here when it broke.,1
Ses05F_impro02_F012, I think infantry.  I'm not sure.,1
Ses01F_script03_1_F016," Oh dear, should we like that?",1
Ses03M_script01_3_F023, What is it?,1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F015," Well, that's your business, Chris.",1
Ses04M_script01_1_M012," Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years, now.",1
Ses03M_script01_1_M005, I could hear it right through the floor.,1
Ses03F_impro06_M004," He was in chemo the whole time, right?",1
Ses01M_impro02_M010, ...we're all shipping out.,1
Ses03F_impro06_F031," Yeah. God, I loved that kid.",1
Ses03F_impro02_F035, And- And then I'll stop working and- I'll stay home with the baby.,1
Ses04F_impro02_M001, This is really-this is unfair.,1
Ses02M_script02_2_F035, I didn't say that.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M025, He was studying to be a doctor.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_M006, I guess he is.,1
Ses04M_impro06_M015," I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else.",1
Ses01M_script01_3_F024, How many?,1
Ses05M_script01_3_M039, And I guess that included you.,1
Ses04M_script01_3_F006," I knew they would, your mother, anyway.",1
Ses03M_script03_1_M017, Who knows?,1
Ses05F_impro06_M023, That's the best way to put it.,1
Ses02M_impro04_M020," I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now.",1
Ses01M_impro06_M021, Yeah.,1
Ses03F_script01_3_F024, What is it?,1
Ses04F_script02_2_F026, No.,1
Ses03M_impro06_F017, Well sure you could.,1
Ses03M_script01_1_M004, No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.,1
Ses01M_script02_2_F033, This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.,1
Ses02F_impro02_F004," Well, we can do the best we can and-and, with um, you know like wireless internet these days--I think that we could-- Talk every once in awhile.",1
Ses03F_script01_2_F011," She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-",1
Ses01M_impro06_F027, Yeah.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M008, It's just really...really messed up.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_M007," I don't know the meaning of it.  But, I know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",1
Ses02F_script01_1_M015, All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,1
Ses05M_script02_2_F031," For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.",1
Ses02F_impro04_F013," I-I just I think maybe I should try something else.  I mean, I-I don't know.  All growing up this is the only thing that I ever wanted to do and yet I can't.  I'm not physically able apparently.  I mean--",1
Ses02M_script02_2_F034," I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",1
Ses04M_script01_1_F031," Alright, then, mom.",1
Ses01M_impro06_M027, Yeah.,1
Ses01F_impro06_F020," It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.",1
Ses05F_script01_1_M016," You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?",1
Ses02M_impro06_F013, Are you going to be okay?,1
Ses04M_script01_1_M002, About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.,1
Ses02F_impro02_F011," I mean, it's just as hard for me, but--I know that we can do it, you know",1
Ses03M_script01_3_F029, How many?,1
Ses03F_impro06_F020," Can you imagine, though, you know, as a parent, just losing a kid? Twenty-two years old.",1
Ses04F_impro02_M016, You can do it today.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.,1
Ses05M_script02_2_M029," Now, I know.  Me either",1
Ses05F_script01_3_M034, And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.,1
Ses05M_impro06_M007," he just did everything.  He was literally, literally the most talented guy I have ever met in my entire life.",1
Ses03F_script01_3_F026," Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.",1
Ses01M_impro06_M005, I just...I just basically lost someone that was really close to me.,1
Ses03M_impro04_M000, I'm just so tired all the time.,1
Ses01M_script01_3_M033," You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.",1
Ses02F_impro06_F006," I mean, he was like really conscious right up until the end. you know",1
Ses03M_impro06_F004, You guys were real close huh?,1
Ses01M_script01_3_F023," Yeah, sure.",1
Ses04M_script01_3_F023," Oh, gees.",1
Ses01M_impro02_M006," I guess they can do it,",1
Ses04F_script01_3_M027, You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,1
Ses03M_script01_1_F040, Tell me something.  You can leave this business?,1
Ses03F_script03_1_F015," Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?",1
Ses02F_impro06_F007," He was so young, you know.  And all the stories he used to tell me about...",1
Ses03F_impro04_F002," I just, I see all these other people getting commercials and work and it's like I'm not getting anything.",1
Ses02M_script02_2_F015, Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.,1
Ses02F_impro06_F010, He did a lot.  But--,1
Ses03M_impro06_M019, then I got busy with work and stuff and three years go by,1
Ses01M_script01_3_M029," For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.",1
Ses05M_script02_2_F032," Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.",1
Ses04F_impro06_M011, You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.,1
Ses01M_impro05_M029," Well, I don't need to take this kind of abuse either.  I just was trying get back to Atlanta. I just got home, I just want to get my bag and get my stuff. And keep my job.",1
Ses01F_impro06_F012," I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever.",1
Ses04M_impro06_M011, This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.,1
Ses05M_impro06_F002," Oh, I'm so sorry",1
Ses03M_impro06_M021, I mean I haven't even talked to him on the phone for the past three months.,1
Ses04F_script02_2_M040, Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,1
Ses03M_script01_1_F035," Look, just give it some thought okay?",1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F027," No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.",1
Ses03F_script02_2_M017," It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, right? You said let's get some champagne, and I said time's-a-wasting or something like that.",1
Ses05F_impro02_M025, It's not fair.,1
Ses03M_impro02_F017, I'm sick of being strong-- --for us.,1
Ses04F_impro02_F013, What do you want me to do?,1
Ses03M_script01_3_F028," Yeah, sure.",1
Ses05M_script01_1b_M024," Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it seems like she's forgotten him.",1
Ses01M_impro06_M014, It was kind of like boom... done,1
Ses05M_script01_1b_M023, I wanted to get this settled first.,1
Ses02F_impro02_F005, You could send me pictures.,1
Ses03F_impro06_F011, He's so young. It seems so--,1
Ses03M_script02_2_F036, I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.,1
Ses04F_impro06_M000," Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened.  I don't um- I mean what you can you do?  I mean it's-",1
Ses01M_script01_3_F026, Do you still feel that way?,1
Ses04F_script02_2_M022, Okay.  Right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen you want to dance?,1
Ses05F_script01_1_F008, What's the meaning of that?,1
Ses04M_impro06_F006, I know.  It never is.,1
Ses01M_impro06_F002, You don't have to if you don't want to.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M029, Just about all.,1
Ses05M_script01_3_M025, I lost them.,1
Ses05F_impro02_F032, You'll have to send me pictures and letters everyday.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M024," You know, it's like affecting a lot of people it's not just me, you know?",1
Ses03F_impro02_F006," I really want to say that. Well I, so, you know, at the center department they called me in and I talked to-",1
Ses05F_impro06_F012," I feel really bad for his family, you know.",1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F021," Well, you're a considerate fella.  There's nothing wrong with that.",1
Ses01M_impro06_M018," Exactly, you know, and like he had so many plans and he was going to do...",1
Ses02F_impro06_F012, I won't be able to hear his voice or his--,1
Ses02M_script02_2_F020, I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.,1
Ses01M_impro02_M005, They can do it.,1
Ses02F_impro04_M020, I don't know.,1
Ses03M_script03_1_F026, It went on intermittently for days.,1
Ses01M_impro02_M015, You're going to be fine.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M015, and the kids are paralyzed in a coma right now.,1
Ses05M_script01_3_F019, Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,1
Ses05F_impro02_F038," I love you.  I'm going to miss you so much. ""sigh""",1
Ses05F_impro04_F023, I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.,1
Ses02M_script01_1_M027," Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.",1
Ses04M_impro06_F008," I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you-",1
Ses01M_impro02_M017, I know I have a good... I have a really good group of guys with me.,1
Ses01F_script02_1_M003, No.  That's just foam.  I don't know.  I can't tell.,1
Ses03F_impro02_F008, And Uh- Yeah. Uh- They're going to need um- more nurses on call for uh- to go overseas to help out with the war.,1
Ses03F_impro06_F015," I know. He was, he had so much going for him.",1
Ses04F_impro02_F015," You're not making this any easier for me, you know.  I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping.",1
Ses04M_script01_3_F019, You've got to tell me.,1
Ses05F_script03_1_F029, That was the first time you ever hit me.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M016, and just going to the funeral it's-,1
Ses04F_impro02_M014, I can't deal with this emotionally.,1
Ses04M_script01_1_F006, What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F037," I don't understand you, do I?",1
Ses02F_script01_1_F042," All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me?",1
Ses03F_impro02_M026," we'll get money, all right? You don't need the job, all right?",1
Ses02F_script02_2_F031, Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,1
Ses04M_script02_2_M035, I'm doing the best I can.,1
Ses03F_impro02_F012, yeah,1
Ses05F_impro04_F015, I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.,1
Ses02M_script02_2_M031," No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us",1
Ses04M_impro06_F014," I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.",1
Ses04F_script01_1_M017, I'm going to ask her to marry me.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M030, I'm not thinking about just me; I'm thinking about our child.,1
Ses04F_script01_1_M044, I am thinking that way.,1
Ses01F_impro06_M000," I'm sorry, Joy.",1
Ses04F_script02_2_F038, I didn't say that.,1
Ses04F_impro02_F011, What's that supposed to mean?,1
Ses05F_impro04_F022, That's really hard to hear.,1
Ses03M_script01_1_M047, No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,1
Ses03M_impro03_F037, Oh man.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_F033," that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",1
Ses04M_script01_1_F007, He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that?,1
Ses03F_script01_3_F021, I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.,1
Ses03M_script02_2_F025, No.,1
Ses05M_script03_1_F027, That was the first time you hit me.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M029," How is she going to feel the first year in school, no mom.",1
Ses01M_impro06_F007, Was it an accident?,1
Ses04F_impro02_M007, You do have a choice.  You don't have to go.,1
Ses04F_impro02_F002, I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.,1
Ses03M_script01_2_F010," My worst times I think about her, you know, and I",1
Ses01M_impro06_M012, What?,1
Ses02F_impro02_F001," There's nothing I can do.  I mean, the government you know--",1
Ses05F_impro02_F027, I know.,1
Ses03F_impro02_F031," and if we survive, if we survive that then babe, you know you know we could survive any--",1
Ses03F_impro06_M012," So nice, so positive.",1
Ses04F_script01_2_F020, Just don't stop believing.,1
Ses05M_impro06_M020, Thanks.,1
Ses04F_impro02_M000, So you're leaving tomorrow.,1
Ses05F_impro06_M015," Of course. If there's anything I can do, you just let me know.  Okay?",1
Ses03M_script01_1_F019, Well that's your business Chris.,1
Ses02F_script01_3_F004," Well, for one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.",1
Ses03F_script01_3_M005," Yes, I guess I have been. But it's going from me now.",1
Ses03F_script01_2_F020, You got to keep believing.,1
Ses02M_script01_1_M002, About four this morning. I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.,1
Ses01F_impro06_F025," But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.",1
Ses05F_script01_1_F031," You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",1
Ses05M_impro06_F009, Yeah. I understand.  I think it's really healthy to grieve.,1
Ses03F_impro06_F001, Yeah. Wow.,1
Ses02F_impro06_F005, And his whole family was there.,1
Ses04M_impro06_F017, I know.,1
Ses03F_impro02_F019, But it- it is for a year.,1
Ses02M_script02_2_F033, I know that Augie. Really I do.,1
Ses05F_script02_2_F013," Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.",1
Ses03M_script01_3_M015, Why didn't you?,1
Ses04M_impro06_F015," When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--",1
Ses02M_script02_2_M038," No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.",1
Ses01M_script01_2_F014, I can't help it.,1
Ses04M_script03_1_F010," Yes, meaning just that.",1
Ses04M_script01_3_M035," You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.",1
Ses03F_impro06_F022, Because this other half was just kind of like ripped away.,1
Ses01M_script01_3_M024, It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.,1
Ses02F_impro02_M003," Well, come on.  You've gotta think of something.  A year--a year away, it's gonna tear us apart.  I don't even--I don't even wanna think about it.  I mean, I don't even know if I'll be able to get in touch with you or--",1
Ses04M_script01_3_M033, because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;,1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F028," Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",1
Ses03F_impro04_F020," Yeah, so I go to--get an education for four years and I'm waiting tables at Denny's.",1
Ses02M_impro04_F009, I'm sorry.,1
Ses01M_script02_1_M036, And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M030, I can't do that.,1
Ses01F_impro06_F013, I don't know.,1
Ses03M_script01_1_M035, Alright then.,1
Ses01F_impro06_M003, You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.,1
Ses01F_script01_2_F014, I can't help it.,1
Ses04F_script03_1_F018," Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",1
Ses02M_impro02_F014, I'll miss you too.,1
Ses05M_script01_3_M040," I want you now, Annie.",1
Ses03F_script01_3_F033," Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.",1
Ses02M_impro06_M021," It's just going to take a while, I think.",1
Ses05M_impro06_F005, Yeah.  I'm so sorry.,1
Ses02M_script01_1_M008, Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,1
Ses01M_script02_2_M046," Actually, you know what?  Now you mentioned that--no I don't.",1
Ses04M_script01_3_M028," For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",1
Ses05M_script02_2_F029, But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_M035, Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_M026, I wanted to get this settled first.,1
Ses01M_script01_3_M026, Well I lost them.,1
Ses04M_script01_1_M034," father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.",1
Ses02F_impro02_M012, All right.,1
Ses02M_script01_1_F018," Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-",1
Ses01M_script01_1_M024," No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.",1
Ses01M_script01_3_F028, Everything Chris do you understand that?  To me too...,1
Ses04M_script01_3_M007, I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_M012, And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,1
Ses02M_script03_1_F017," Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",1
Ses04M_impro02_M024, Next week.,1
Ses03F_script01_3_F016, I was almost married two years ago.,1
Ses03F_script03_1_F016," Well, that's serious enough.",1
Ses03F_script01_3_M042, And I didn't want to take any of it.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_F006," Look,",1
Ses04M_impro06_M018, I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.,1
Ses05F_script01_1_M033," I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?",1
Ses02M_script02_1_M031, I don't get it. The first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life.,1
Ses04F_script01_1_M031, I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her.,1
Ses05F_impro02_F029, We'll figure something out.  We just have to ... we just have to think about this.  Could any of your family help us?,1
Ses05F_impro02_M034," Yeah, we'll call them.  We'll figure something out.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  You're right.",1
Ses05M_impro06_M010," you know, sometimes you think you want to make that phone call, or you think you want to tell somebody something, or something like that.  Do you know what I mean?  Like that's -- he was the person that I did that with.  You know, like, that's the person who I needed to call to tell things to all the time.",1
Ses05M_script02_2_F012, I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.,1
Ses02M_script02_2_M035," No, I know. Me neither.",1
Ses02M_script02_2_M037, Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,1
Ses04F_impro06_M013," That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can.",1
Ses04M_script01_3_F003," In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.",1
Ses04F_script01_3_F008, From her point of view why else would I come?,1
Ses05F_script02_2_M029, Yes it is.,1
Ses03M_script02_2_M036, Maybe if you were with someone else too.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_F024, How many?,1
Ses04M_script01_3_M022," Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.",1
Ses05M_script01_1_F005, He cried hard?,1
Ses04M_impro02_F004, Don't go.,1
Ses03F_impro06_M005, And he just got that baseball scholarship.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M043," when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.",1
Ses03M_impro06_F002, So sad.,1
Ses02M_impro02_F009," Well, just promise me that you going to be safe.",1
Ses05F_impro06_F009, And he could of...  He was pretty awesome,1
Ses03M_script01_3_M030, Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.,1
Ses01M_script02_1_M034, All right.,1
Ses02F_script01_3_F026, You still feel that way?,1
Ses02M_impro06_M003," I mean at least she was home, she wasn't in the hospital anymore,",1
Ses03M_script01_3_M023," Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.",1
Ses02M_impro02_F004, It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll,1
Ses02M_script01_2_F017, I can't help it.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M010, You know what happened to my cousin. She went and she never came back.,1
Ses03M_impro02_M025, They want me there two years but I could probably get,1
Ses04F_script02_2_F035, But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,1
Ses05F_impro06_M002, That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?,1
Ses04F_impro02_M025, You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?,1
Ses01M_impro06_F015, Lock,1
Ses05F_impro02_M033, Yeah.  I guess.  I don't know what they're going to say.,1
Ses05M_impro06_M012," You think that things get easier, you know, as you as you get older and you -",1
Ses04F_script02_2_F019, We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes,1
Ses03M_impro02_M008, --need me on the specialist honey.,1
Ses03F_script01_3_M016, Then he's gone forever. You're sure?,1
Ses04M_script01_1_M006, I guess he is.,1
Ses05F_script01_3_M025, Yeah.  I lost them.,1
Ses05F_script02_2_F021, No.,1
Ses03M_script02_2_F023, I'd rather not remember something...,1
Ses01M_script02_2_F040," You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.",1
Ses03F_script02_2_F025, Hope for some things.,1
Ses01M_script01_1_M015," Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right?",1
Ses04M_impro02_F020, When do you leave?,1
Ses01M_script01_3_M042, Annie...,1
Ses03M_script01_2_F011, it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.,1
Ses03F_script02_2_F024, I don't want to remember something.,1
Ses01M_script03_1_M014," Darling, don't say that.",1
Ses04F_script01_1_M003," I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back into the house and cried in the kitchen.",1
Ses02M_impro02_F000, I don't want you to go.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_F024," No, what is it?  Your mother?",1
Ses02M_impro04_M022, Right. Thanks for talking to me.,1
Ses04F_script01_1_M036," I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else, maybe New York.",1
Ses05M_script01_1_M002," I don't know, like, four o'clock this morning.  I heard a crack, and I woke up, and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it broke.",1
Ses05F_script01_1_F000, What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,1
Ses03F_script02_2_F051," I'm sorry, Augie.",1
Ses03M_impro02_M007, I told them that but they--,1
Ses02M_impro02_M000," I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot.",1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F011, You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?,1
Ses05M_impro06_M006," He was a designer, you know.  But he did everything. You know, He painted and he- and he did costume design, he did set design, he did lighting, he was --",1
Ses04F_impro06_M005," you know, it's inevitable  and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like",1
Ses04F_impro06_F006, It just doesn't seem fair.,1
Ses04F_impro02_M008, You have a choice.,1
Ses03M_script03_1_F017," What happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the other one still laugh?",1
Ses02F_script01_1_M002, About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_F006, Well kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M036, And then I came home and it was amazing.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_M003, Oh.,1
Ses03F_impro02_F043, I'm so sorry.,1
Ses02F_impro06_F001," We knew that it was coming, but--",1
Ses05M_script01_1b_M011," Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",1
Ses01M_impro06_F018, It leaves a hole for you too.,1
Ses01M_script02_2_M031, What?  What?  You want to divorce?,1
Ses04F_script01_3_F004," In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.",1
Ses03F_impro02_F036, It's all I ever knew how to do. I can't quit now.,1
Ses02F_script02_2_F044," Augie, I'm sorry.",1
Ses01M_script01_3_F029, And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air.  You should be proud of that a man should be paid for that.,1
Ses05F_impro06_F026, It's hard to say good-bye.,1
Ses05F_impro06_F010," Uh,  We grew up together.",1
Ses01M_script01_1_F015," To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you?",1
Ses02F_impro02_F006," Their not gonna let you.  You have to stay home and I have to go.  I mean, that's all--",1
Ses05F_impro06_F015, [BREATHING],1
Ses03M_impro06_F020, Now I can't.,1
Ses03F_impro04_F022, it's not funny. I just don't know what I'm going to do.,1
Ses04F_impro02_M019, It's just really unfair.  This is- this is bullshit.,1
Ses03F_impro02_F025, It's going to be okay.,1
Ses05M_impro06_M009," I mean, one second you think, you know, you're just having a conversation and then --",1
Ses01M_impro02_M007," The National Guard is I guess really spread thin and then everyone has to go.  We all have to go back, my whole companies going back.",1
Ses03F_script01_3_M032, It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.,1
Ses01M_impro06_F019," It leaves a hole for you too, in your plans together.",1
Ses05F_impro02_F011, Iraq.,1
Ses05F_script01_3_M031," And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-",1
Ses05F_impro06_F004, [BREATHING],1
Ses01M_script01_3_F018," Chris, what's the matter?",1
Ses05M_script01_1_F034, You can't think like that.,1
Ses04M_script02_2_F033," For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",1
Ses03F_impro06_F030, so I was there for him.,1
Ses01F_script02_2_M037," Maybe if you were with someone else, too.",1
Ses02F_script01_3_M010," You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",1
Ses04F_script01_3_M035, a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?,1
Ses04M_impro06_F011, You feel that way now because you're upset.  But you don't really think that.,1
Ses01M_impro02_M016," I'm going to be fine too, okay?",1
Ses05M_script01_1_F016," Well, I have an idea.  But what's the story?",1
Ses03M_script02_2_F026, No.,1
Ses02F_impro02_M010, ...it would be so much better if we can--if we could stay together somehow.  You know--we could--we could do this together.,1
Ses01M_script01_1_M003, I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried.,1
Ses03F_script02_2_F016, Do you remember the last time we came here?,1
Ses04F_impro02_F003, I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that.,1
Ses03F_script01_3_F027, You should tell me.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_M022," Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",1
Ses01M_script01_3_M031," They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...",1
Ses02F_script01_3_M032," And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",1
Ses03M_script01_1_F023, You know I ignore what I got to ignore.,1
Ses04F_script01_2_F021, I can't help it.,1
Ses05F_impro06_M013, yeah.,1
Ses05M_impro06_F004, What did he do?,1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F003, What was he doing out here four in the morning?,1
Ses01M_impro06_F023, Mmhmm.,1
Ses03M_impro02_M006, They said anywhere from two to three years.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_F020," Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't going to--",1
Ses03F_script02_2_F028," No, no.",1
Ses02F_script01_3_F023," Yeah, sure.",1
Ses05F_impro02_F035," ""sigh"" Three weeks.",1
Ses05F_impro06_F001," Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,",1
Ses03M_impro02_F018, You can say no?,1
Ses05M_script01_1_F006," What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died, walking around at night.  He dreams.",1
Ses04M_script01_3_M004, The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.,1
Ses04F_impro02_M003," I mean we both knew that this was going to happen.  It's just that I feel that, you know, I don't want Susie growing up without a mother.",1
Ses02M_script01_3_F004," For one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.",1
Ses05F_script02_2_F019, No.,1
Ses01M_impro06_F012, Yeah.,1
Ses03F_impro02_F013," Well, I'm leaving in three weeks, but-- Yeah.",1
Ses02M_script01_1_M045," No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",1
Ses03M_impro02_F010, You can't.  We need you.  I need you.,1
Ses03M_script02_2_F040, If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.,1
Ses04F_impro06_M003, Yeah.,1
Ses03M_impro06_F011, We're all here for you.,1
Ses02M_script02_2_F036," For heavens sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",1
Ses01M_script01_3_M020, Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.,1
Ses03F_impro04_F006," I know, I just don't know if I can handle it. I mean, you're helping me so much financially it's like I can't survive on my own without you. I don't like that.",1
Ses03M_impro06_F013, just things happen in life and you just...there's just no explanation you know?  We just don't...,1
Ses03M_impro06_M014, The mother and father died--,1
Ses01M_script01_1_M007, I guess he is.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_F026," 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.",1
Ses02F_impro06_F009, Nobody's ever gonna forget him.,1
Ses05F_script01_3_M027, Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-,1
Ses05M_script03_1_F018," That's rather serious, isn't it?",1
Ses03M_script01_3_M041, Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.,1
Ses03F_impro06_F021," It's weird, I kind of feel like part of me is gone now, you know?",1
Ses02M_script01_2_F008," She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",1
Ses04M_impro02_F009, You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?,1
Ses01M_impro06_M013," He was sick. He got sick. He got sick but it happened really, really fast, you know.",1
Ses05F_impro06_F020, Thanks.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M019," so many things, you know?",1
Ses05M_script01_1_F007, What's the meaning of that?,1
Ses03M_impro02_M014, Honey.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M001," Just kind of feel numb, you know.",1
Ses01M_script01_1_M006, I don't know.,1
Ses04M_impro06_M006," I mean, they're, you know, they're upset.  It's like you know, they",1
Ses05M_script01_1_F001, When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?,1
Ses02F_script01_3_M031, Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.,1
Ses02M_impro06_M005," Yes. I mean, it's not as rough on me as it is on him but",1
Ses03F_impro06_F002," Mmm hmm. I never knew it was going to be this hard, you know.",1
Ses01M_script01_3_M038, 'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...,1
Ses03M_impro02_F006, Overseas?,1
Ses05F_impro06_M004, It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young?,1
Ses03M_impro02_F023, You said two years.,1
Ses03M_impro05a_M014, Yeah.,1
Ses05M_script01_3_F024, Do you still feel like that?,1
Ses03F_impro04_F024, Yeah,1
Ses05F_impro02_M022," I no I can't- ""sigh""",1
Ses05F_script01_3_M022, I don't know how to start.,1
Ses02M_impro02_F002, I don't want to be a single mom.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M006, He was supposed to be the best man at my wedding.,1
Ses01M_script01_3_M021," No, no, it's nothing like that.",1
Ses05F_script01_1_M000, He saw it.,1
Ses05F_impro02_M013, Can we do something else?  Can you tell them that you just had two kids?,1
Ses02M_script01_1_F015, I got an idea but what's the story?,1
Ses05M_script01_3_M033, It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M016, You can't leave your daughter alone like this.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_F000, What's he gonna say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,1
Ses04M_script02_2_F034, Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else; somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,1
Ses02M_impro06_F015, Sure,1
Ses05F_impro02_M024, I'll tell them I'm sick and that you can't leave something.,1
Ses02F_script01_3_F005," You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--",1
Ses01M_impro02_M014," Hey listen, it's going to be okay though, all right?",1
Ses03M_impro06_M003, It just feels like I was talking to him yesterday.,1
Ses04M_impro02_M000, It's only going to be a year.,1
Ses04M_impro06_M002, a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.,1
Ses05F_script02_2_F032," Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.",1
Ses02M_impro06_M009," not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean.",1
Ses05F_impro02_F004," I got a call today,",1
Ses02F_impro02_F002," You're gonna have to.  I mean, you're a great father.  You can do it.  I know you can.",1
Ses05M_script01_1_F015, Why?,1
Ses04F_impro06_F004," Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair.  I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was-",1
Ses04F_script01_3_M031," For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.",1
Ses03M_impro04_M030, Maybe I'll just kill myself.,1
Ses03F_impro06_M016, I'm sure he loved you too. He just didn't know it.,1
Ses05F_impro06_M006, It's the think,1
Ses05F_script01_1_F006, He is thinking about him again.,1
Ses04F_script01_1_M011," Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",1
Ses04M_script01_3_F018," Then what's wrong.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.",1
Ses02M_impro04_M015," maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know.",1
Ses01M_script01_1_M038, Then help me stay here mom.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M003, [BREATHING] Umm.,1
Ses05F_script02_2_F022, No.,1
Ses03F_impro02_F021," You know as much as -as much as me that I-I want to stay here with you and Amy so bad, but I can't.",1
Ses05F_script01_3_F019," What is it?  Even in your letters, there is something ashamed.",1
Ses02F_script01_1_M034," But if I can't--if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",1
Ses02M_script01_3_M001, You're not sorry you came?,1
Ses03F_impro02_F037," Well, we- we tell her mommy's going on va- on a trip for for- a while.",1
Ses04F_impro02_M004," And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.",1
Ses05M_script01_1_F013," To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?",1
Ses05F_impro02_F005, I'm going to need to go overseas for a while.,1
Ses05M_script01_3_F004, You saw that.  And well you've been --,1
Ses02M_impro06_F010, And she was,1
Ses03F_script01_2_F019," Believe, Joe. You above all people have got to believe.",1
Ses03F_impro06_F032, yeah.,1
Ses05F_script01_1_M004, No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,1
Ses04F_impro02_M006," I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen.",1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F023," Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.",1
Ses02M_script01_1_M006, I guess he is.,1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F005, He's dreaming about him again.  He's getting just like after Larry died. What's the meaning of that?,1
Ses05F_impro06_M017, Is there a funeral planned? or-,1
Ses03M_impro06_F019, I would've loved to.,1
Ses05M_script01_1_F030, Just give it some more thought.,1
Ses04F_script01_1_F007, He's getting just like after he died.,1
Ses04M_impro06_M016, I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.,1
Ses02M_script01_1_M028," I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.",1
Ses01M_script02_1_M035," I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life...",1
Ses05M_impro06_F008," Wow, Ryan I know that you are hurting right now but I don't think you always feel like that.",1
Ses05F_script01_3_F023, Oh gee.,1
Ses04F_script01_1_M006, I guess he is.,1
Ses03M_script01_1_M018, You know.,1
Ses03M_impro02_F029, far away and he won't be here.,1
Ses04M_script01_1_M004, No.  I - I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.,1
Ses03M_script01_1_F007, Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again.,1
Ses02F_impro02_F003, I don't think so.,1
Ses01M_impro02_F011, Me?  I'm not worried about me.,1
Ses03M_impro02_M011, No.,1
Ses01M_script01_3_F019," No, what is it?  Is your mother?",1
Ses02F_script01_3_M025, Just about all.,1
Ses04M_script01_1_F042," I don't understand you, do I?",1
Ses03F_impro02_F041," I didn't expect this to happen. I never planned for this. Some things you just don't plan for, you know.",1
Ses02F_script02_2_F025, No.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M040, because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.,1
Ses01F_script02_2_M038, I just- I know I don't make you happy.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M028, How are we supposed to tell Amy? How's she supposed to understand that?,1
Ses03M_impro02_F020, I know.,1
Ses04M_script01_1_M027," Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me.",1
Ses05F_script01_2_F013," Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",1
Ses03M_impro02_M004, They want to deploy me next week.,1
Ses05M_impro06_M015," And I don't know why people don't just tell you off the bat that it's just gonna suck anyway.  You know, like, what's the point?",1
Ses02M_script01_1_F016," Well that's only your business, Chris.",1
Ses04F_impro02_F008, Look we both knew what this meant when I signed on,1
Ses05M_script01_1_M008, Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,1
Ses02M_script01_2_F016, Don't stop believing.,1
Ses02F_script02_2_M030," No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska?",1
Ses02F_impro02_F008," I know, but, she needs to be safe more.  She needs to be around kids her age--own age.  She needs to be able to play on the streets and--",1
Ses03F_impro02_M019, I don't know if I- if I could take it.,1
Ses03F_script01_3_M043, And I guess that included you.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_F004, Did you talk to him?,1
Ses03F_script01_3_F025, No. What is it? Is it your mother?,1
Ses01M_script01_1_F031," He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.",1
Ses05F_impro06_M019, No problem.,1
Ses04F_impro02_M011, It's just not going to work out without you here.,1
Ses05M_impro06_M005," he wanted to travel, you know.  And he's so talented.  Probably the most talented person I have ever met in my entire life.",1
Ses05M_script02_2_F030, I didn't say that.,1
Ses03M_impro02_M016, I don't know what to do.,1
Ses01M_impro06_F020, It gets better.,1
Ses03F_script01_3_M028, I don't know where to start.,1
Ses03M_impro06_F003, Yeah.,1
Ses05F_impro02_F008," I don't know ""sigh"".",1
Ses04M_impro06_M008," [BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again.",1
Ses04M_impro06_F001, I'm sorry.,1
Ses03M_script01_2_F017," Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.",1
Ses02F_impro02_M009," I mean, you just get to--go off and do your thing.  I mean, yeah, we're both--I don't know--it's bad for both of us, but--",1
Ses01M_impro06_M006," And I've kind of been dealing with all of the...the stuff, you know the hospital and people work because...",1
Ses03F_impro02_M018, I don't know if I can handle you going another year.,1
Ses03M_script02_2_M040, It seemed like a good spot to me.,1
Ses01F_script02_2_F023, No.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_M032," Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.",1
Ses02M_script01_1_M018, I'm going to ask her to marry me.,1
Ses05F_script01_3_F025," Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",1
Ses02M_impro04_M008," Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, like",1
Ses05F_script02_2_F026," Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",1
Ses03F_script01_3_F029," Yeah, sure.",1
Ses02F_script02_2_M037, Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,1
Ses02M_script02_2_F022, No.,1
Ses02M_impro06_F005, Yeah.,1
Ses01M_impro06_F026, It's good that you were there.,1
Ses04F_script01_1_M001, He was out here when it broke.,1
Ses04M_impro06_M009, Yeah.,1
Ses01F_impro06_M007, Yeah.,1
Ses04M_impro06_M012," I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -",1
Ses05F_impro04_F027," Well, thank you.",1
Ses01F_script02_2_F040," You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.",1
Ses04F_impro06_M014, So-,1
Ses05F_impro04_F019, I'm just worried.,1
Ses05F_script01_1_M006," I guess, he is.",1
Ses03M_impro06_M028, Working for corporate America?  Wow.,1
Ses04F_impro02_F006, Do you think I want to leave you?,1
Ses04M_script01_3_M025, Well I lost them.,1
Ses05F_impro06_F025, yeah.,1
Ses03M_script01_1_F027, You're a considerate fellow.  There is nothing wrong in that.,1
Ses03M_impro02_M037, Fine.  I'll see if I can talk to them.,1
Ses02F_script01_3_M030," You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",1
Ses02F_impro04_F014," I guess the money shouldn't matter to me, but--Somehow it does.  You know? It's not like I do it for the money, but",1
Ses02M_script02_2_F038," You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.",1
Ses01M_script03_1_F020," Oh, will we like that?",1
Ses01F_impro06_F021," My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.",1
Ses01M_script02_2_F034, This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?,1
Ses02F_script01_1_M014," Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",1
Ses03M_script01_3_F004, No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.,1
Ses01F_script03_1_F017, What happens if one of us dies?  Does the other one still laugh?,1
Ses04M_script01_3_M024," It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",1
Ses01M_impro06_F025, That's a long time.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M013, You remember the last time you went? You know how hard it was for me? Now we have a kid.,1
Ses04M_impro06_M010," Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--",1
Ses04M_script01_3_M006, Well wouldn't you want to?,1
Ses02M_script01_2_M006," All right. Now, listen kid-",1
Ses02M_impro02_M006, You gotta,1
Ses03F_impro06_F024, He was my brother.,1
Ses04M_impro06_F012," It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those.",1
Ses05F_impro02_M026, Why has to be you?  There's all those other people.  Somebody else can go instead.  It's not right.,1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F013, Why?,1
Ses02M_impro02_F001," I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard.",1
Ses02F_impro06_M002, I'm sorry to hear about that.,1
Ses04F_impro02_F007, I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?,1
Ses01M_impro06_F005, Oh Jesus.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M000," Yeah, I'm just-- yeah",1
Ses02F_impro06_F013, You start to lose like that image after a while.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_M001, He was out here when it broke.,1
Ses02M_script02_2_M039, Yeah?,1
Ses05F_impro06_F022, something happens and they die and it's like-,1
Ses05F_script01_3_M021," Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",1
Ses05F_impro02_F009, I know.  I know.,1
Ses03F_script01_3_M029, You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.,1
Ses01M_impro02_F019, Don't say that.,1
Ses01M_script02_2_F036," I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.",1
Ses02F_script01_1_M000, He saw it.,1
Ses04M_impro06_F009," Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.",1
Ses04F_impro02_M017, Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go.,1
Ses04F_impro06_M001," When I was seven, my- my grandmother died and I really- I don't know, I mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is- is that you do let go and your realize that, you know, they- you know, they- this person had fun while they were- while they were here and, uh, you know, you work- you work through it.",1
Ses04M_script01_1_M008, Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M007," He kind of didn't have anyone to take care of that for him, so--",1
Ses03M_script01_3_M042, And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.,1
Ses04F_script01_1_M045, No.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,1
Ses02F_impro05_F021, Thank you.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M006," God, we're supposed to take a look at a house next week.",1
Ses05F_impro02_M029, I understand.  I'm worried about you.  I don't know what's going to happen to you.,1
Ses01M_impro06_F010, Oh. Really fast? Oh.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_F043," I don't understand you, do I?",1
Ses01M_impro02_M020, I know.,1
Ses04F_script01_1_F008, What's the meaning in that?,1
Ses01M_impro06_F011, Yeah.,1
Ses05F_impro06_M014, Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.,1
Ses01F_script02_2_F036, I didn't say that.,1
Ses04M_impro06_M004, Thanks.,1
Ses03F_script01_3_M033," For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.",1
Ses04M_script02_2_F016," It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.",1
Ses03M_impro06_M004, He was my only friend growing up.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_F011," Well,",1
Ses03M_script02_2_M020, It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...,1
Ses02F_impro06_F014, Thanks.,1
Ses05M_script01_3_F025," Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.",1
Ses04M_impro02_F007, Can't you ask them?  Can't you go back and ask them if you could -- I don't know if you could change  assignments or something and you could stay here?,1
Ses02M_script01_2_F012," why did that happen the very night she came back she sleeps in his room and suddenly his memorial breaks to pieces, just look at it, look.",1
Ses03F_script01_3_F020, You always can be so ambiguous.,1
Ses03F_impro06_F019, Not very good.,1
Ses03M_impro02_F009, Honey--,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M013," You think this is wrong, this chair, this yard.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",1
Ses02M_script01_1_F008, What?,1
Ses03M_script01_1_M046, I am thinking like that.,1
Ses02F_script02_2_F024, No.,1
Ses02M_impro02_M018," I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you.",1
Ses04M_script01_3_M011," You think this is wrong, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",1
Ses05M_script01_3_F002, No.  But I'm not going to stay.,1
Ses02F_script01_3_M034, Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.,1
Ses05M_script01_3_M036," I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.",1
Ses02F_script01_3_F024, How many?,1
Ses02M_script01_1_F041," Yea, I can see that.",1
Ses03M_script01_1_F008," He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?",1
Ses01F_script02_2_F022, I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_F022, It wouldn't work this way.,1
Ses02F_impro02_F007," and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay.",1
Ses04M_script01_3_F024, And do you still feel that way?,1
Ses02F_impro02_M007, But she's--you're not gonna--you're not gonna be here for--for her first words.  For her first steps.  I mean--it's something that you're supposed to be here for that--,1
Ses05M_script01_1b_M003," I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.",1
Ses01F_script03_2_M017, That reply has broken my heart.,1
Ses05F_impro06_M020," Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real.",1
Ses02M_impro04_M021, What am I going to do on a break?,1
Ses01M_script02_1_M003," No, I think that's just foam.",1
Ses05M_script02_2_F027," This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?",1
Ses03M_impro06_F010, Yeah.  Like I mean if you need anyone to talk to or anything I'm here for you okay?,1
Ses04F_script01_1_F043, I don't understand you do I?,1
Ses05F_script02_2_M030, Right.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M003, Well.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_F006, What was he doing out here at that hour?,1
Ses03F_script02_2_M018," You want this to be like the other time, right? That's it. Right?",1
Ses03M_impro06_F015, I'm so sorry.,1
Ses04M_script01_3_M005, How did you know?,1
Ses04F_impro06_F001," You know it's just, I just, you know, I mean it just happened.  I just, like- I just keep expecting him to walk in, you know.",1
Ses03M_script02_2_F034, This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?,1
Ses04M_script02_2_F021, No.,1
Ses05M_impro06_M002," The end, he's been sick for awhile.  He had cancer.",1
Ses02F_impro06_F004, I just don't want him to be gone.,1
Ses02M_impro02_M001," You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and",1
Ses02F_impro06_F008, ...the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to Africa and he was gonna--,1
Ses01M_impro06_F009," Well, I'm confused.  He was sick or it was an accident?",1
Ses02M_impro06_M014, We were all going take a trip to Europe you know.,1
Ses01M_impro06_F014, Mmhmm.,1
Ses03M_script02_2_M023," Okay, right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen, do you want to dance?",1
Ses01M_script01_1_M036, If that can't happen here...,1
Ses03F_script02_2_F049, So I was thinking you might be right.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_M033, A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.,1
Ses04F_impro06_M010, You're okay,1
Ses04F_script03_1_F015, We always want to bicker and fight.,1
Ses05F_script01_3_M010," You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",1
Ses01M_impro02_F013, You're going with the same ones?,1
Ses03M_impro02_F014, Carry her for nine months and then yes.,1
Ses03F_script01_3_F004, I can't stay.,1
Ses03F_script02_2_M036," No, I know. But I know I don't make you happy.",1
Ses01F_script02_2_F046," Augie, I'm sorry.",1
Ses05M_impro06_M013," and it just gets worse.  It just gets worse, everything is bad all the time; people die, your friends die, family dies, your best friends die. it's-",1
Ses02M_impro02_M014," and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back",1
Ses03F_impro02_M012, I can't-,1
Ses01M_script01_2_F010, Because if he's not coming back then I'll kill myself.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_M039," open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator",1
Ses03F_impro02_F042," I'm sorry, babe.",1
Ses05F_impro06_M012, Was he very close to his family?,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M022, Let's drive some place.  I want to be alone with you.,1
Ses02M_impro06_F008," Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories.",1
Ses05F_script01_1_F005, He cried hard.,1
Ses04M_script03_1_M016, No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,1
Ses04M_script01_1_M011, Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him.,1
Ses05M_script02_2_F019, No.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M023," No, nothing like that.",1
Ses02M_script01_3_M031," To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",1
Ses03M_impro02_M026, maybe get some vacation-- --once it quiets down there.,1
Ses05F_script01_1_M007, I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.,1
Ses05F_script01_1_M014," Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",1
Ses02M_impro06_M022, Ah.,1
Ses03M_impro02_M010, but they said they'd increase my pay by triple-there promotion.,1
Ses02F_script01_3_F020," Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",1
Ses02M_script01_1_M026, I wanted to get this settled first.,1
Ses01M_impro02_F010, What about the birthday party?,1
Ses05M_script02_2_F017, No.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M012," wanted some place we'd never been, a place where we'd be brand new to each other.",1
Ses01M_script01_3_M036, And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.,1
Ses02M_impro02_M007," You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright?",1
Ses04F_impro06_M002, Mmhmm. Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean it's- it's hard.  It's hard.,1
Ses05F_impro06_F008, I know.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_F020, Well then what's wrong?  Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M015, [BREATHING],1
Ses05F_impro02_M032, I don't know.,1
Ses04M_script01_3_M012, Then he's gone forever?  You're sure?,1
Ses01M_script01_1_M040, Then help me stay.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_F027," I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",1
Ses01M_script02_2_M032, A vacation?,1
Ses04F_impro02_F023, I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.,1
Ses05M_script01_1_M005, I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,1
Ses03M_script02_2_F035, I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.,1
Ses01F_impro06_F002, No.,1
Ses03M_impro02_F033, I need you here.  Anna needs you.,1
Ses02M_script03_1_F015," Oh dear, should we like that?",1
Ses05F_script02_2_F011," I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.",1
Ses05F_script01_1_F016, why?,1
Ses05F_script01_2_F015," You above all, have got to believe, Joe.",1
Ses03M_impro06_M029, He actually wanted to do something.,1
Ses03F_script02_2_F026, No.,1
Ses05M_script02_2_F023, I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.,1
Ses03F_impro02_F029," Look, I need you to be strong for me. 'Cause I can't be the only one that's strong right now, really, I--",1
Ses03F_impro02_F030," But we can work, you know, we--you can write me and we could see pictures",1
Ses04F_script01_3_F026, And do you still feel that way?,1
Ses01M_script02_2_M041, I know me neither.,1
Ses02M_impro06_M019," Well, you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me, I mean it definitely helps",1
Ses03M_script01_2_F019, I can't help it.,1
Ses02M_impro06_M002," I guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot - a lot longer than, uh, they expected but you know, I mean when it actually happens it's just a lot harder.",1
Ses02M_impro02_M013, there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country,1
Ses05F_impro06_F005, Kind of.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M001, alright.,1
Ses02M_impro06_M011," Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great",1
Ses03M_script01_1_M006, I guess he is.,1
Ses03M_impro02_M031, What do you mean?,1
Ses01M_script01_1_M009," I mean, these kinds of things, man they always come back at you.  And this is definitely coming back to us.",1
Ses05F_impro06_F018, Thank you.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_M027, It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,1
Ses03M_impro06_F018, Yeah.,1
Ses01M_script01_3_M022, I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_M002, Why?,1
Ses05F_script02_2_F025, This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,1
Ses05F_impro06_M024, Absolutely.,1
Ses05F_script01_1_F007," It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.",1
Ses04F_impro02_F016, I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.,1
Ses03M_impro02_F024, A whole year? --We're not talking about like a couple months here.  I mean this is a whole year.,1
Ses02F_script02_2_F033," I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.",1
Ses01M_impro02_M002, I just got a letter I have to go back.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_M024," It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in charge of a company?",1
Ses01F_impro06_F026," Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-",1
Ses02M_script01_2_F011," Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. And laugh -- laugh at me but",1
Ses03M_script01_3_M036, And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_M007," Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.",1
Ses03M_impro06_F008, Oh man.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_M027," Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",1
Ses02M_impro06_M012, so loving everybody you know.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_F021, You've got to tell me.,1
Ses03F_impro06_M009, Trying to have a baby.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_F018, What is it Chris?,1
Ses03M_impro06_F016," Well now you can follow his footsteps, you know?  Carry out what he wanted to do.",1
Ses03M_impro02_F030, I'm done.  I can't honey.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M021," me, oh my god.",1
Ses04F_script01_1_M002, About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.,1
Ses03F_impro06_F025," Just seems so unfair, is the way it is.",1
Ses03F_impro02_F027," Wait, you can write me and as you know, send me pictures.",1
Ses03M_script01_2_M013," Calm yourself, alright?",1
Ses05F_impro02_F024," Well, apparently nobody else can go.",1
Ses01M_script01_3_M028," Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know.",1
Ses05F_script03_1_F018," Oh, dear, shall we like that?",1
Ses03M_script01_3_F027, Okay.  It wouldn't work like this?,1
Ses03M_script01_1_M013, We got to say it to him.,1
Ses03F_script01_3_F005," Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER].",1
Ses03F_impro02_M011, Oh,1
Ses03M_script01_1_M045, I know.  Just you help me stay here.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M018, I was supposed to see him last summer,1
Ses04M_impro02_F015," What am I supposed to do, read your letters?",1
Ses02M_impro04_M014," I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking",1
Ses02M_script01_1_M041," Yes, on this I would.",1
Ses03M_impro02_M030, You tell her-- [BREATHING],1
Ses04F_script01_3_M002, Why?,1
Ses03M_impro06_F014, Yeah.,1
Ses05M_script02_2_F015," Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",1
Ses02M_script01_1_F031, Just give it some more thought.,1
Ses03F_script02_2_F040, I didn't say that.,1
Ses04F_script01_1_M032," These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",1
Ses05M_script01_1_F003, What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,1
Ses02M_script01_1_M010," No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.",1
Ses05F_impro06_M005," Absolutely, absolutely.",1
Ses02F_script01_3_M026, It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,1
Ses03M_script02_2_F018, We thought I was pregnant.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_F007," you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...",1
Ses02M_impro06_M018, Then she's gone.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M012, his girlfriend got killed too.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_M033," And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",1
Ses02F_impro02_M006, This is gonna be a--a crucial yet--she's--she's growing up.  She's gonna need you.,1
Ses03F_impro02_F010, yeah.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_F028," Trouble is, you don't see enough women.",1
Ses01M_impro02_M012, I don't know.,1
Ses04F_script02_2_F041, somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,1
Ses05F_script01_1_M001, He was out here when it broke.,1
Ses05F_impro02_M036," All the time, every day, every day.  They have e-mail over there and stuff like that, right? I can send you pictures.",1
Ses02M_script02_2_F021, No.,1
Ses03M_script02_2_F037, I didn't say that.,1
Ses02F_impro04_F009, I feel so worthless.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_F007, He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,1
Ses02M_impro02_M011," but, I mean, I'm going to do whatever I can and get back here as fast as I can.",1
Ses01M_impro02_M023," I really don't want to go, I don't want to go...",1
Ses01M_impro02_M022, Run away?,1
Ses04M_impro06_M013," there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.",1
Ses04M_script01_1_M005, I heard him right through the floor of my room.,1
Ses05F_impro04_F017, I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.,1
Ses02M_impro06_M000, Kathy died last night.,1
Ses01F_impro06_F024," And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...",1
Ses01M_script01_3_F025, [BREATHING]. Geez.,1
Ses05M_script02_1_F016, I'm just not.,1
Ses03F_script01_2_F010," Because she thinks like me, that's why.",1
Ses05M_script01_1b_M015, I'm gonna ask her to marry me.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M011, I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I,1
Ses02F_script01_3_F008," Well,",1
Ses02M_impro02_M016," Yeah, I'll write you every day 'cause you're the only thing that's going to be on my mind.",1
Ses05F_impro04_F002," I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying.",1
Ses04M_script01_3_F017," No, what is it, Chris?  Your mother?",1
Ses04F_impro06_F000, Thanks.,1
Ses03M_script02_1_M029, For real?,1
Ses03F_script01_3_F028," But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.",1
Ses02F_script01_1_M010," No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore?",1
Ses05F_impro06_M011," Yes of course, of course.",1
Ses02M_impro06_M010, She was [garbage],1
Ses03M_impro06_M020, and then something like this happens you know?,1
Ses04M_script01_3_M027, It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,1
Ses04M_script01_2_F016," Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone",1
Ses04F_impro02_M026, Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way.,1
Ses04M_script01_3_F025," Because you mustn't feel that way anymore, Chris.  Because you have a right to everything you have, everything, Chris; to me, too.",1
Ses03M_impro02_F032, Honey I can't do it anymore.,1
Ses05M_script01_1_M026, I wanted to get this taken care of first.,1
Ses02M_script01_1_M033, All right. All right. Mom.,1
Ses05M_script02_2_F018, No.,1
Ses02M_impro06_M020, to talk to somebody but,1
Ses05M_script01_1_M017, I'm going to ask her to marry me.,1
Ses02M_script01_1_M015, All right. All right. Listen to me.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_F008," Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.",1
Ses01M_impro06_M017, So weird you know that like one days it's like you know sounds so stupid but like one day someone's here. And like next day you know they're not here and it just kind of makes you like think about like life and mortality and like that kind of stuff.  You just like used to take for granted--you know.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M029," So weird,",1
Ses04F_script01_3_M001, You're not sorry you came.,1
Ses02M_impro06_M015, Yes.  [BREATHING] God.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_M040," Yes, on this I would.",1
Ses02M_script01_3_F023, How many?,1
Ses03M_impro02_F031, It's over.,1
Ses03F_script01_3_F008," Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.",1
Ses03F_impro02_M017, You can't postpone it?,1
Ses02M_impro06_M008," It's just that- I don't know, it's sort it's sort- of a weird thing you know",1
Ses05F_script01_1_F020, Well you're want to make sure your father isn't you know going to--lose them,1
Ses05M_script02_2_F013, Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.,1
Ses05M_script03_1_F016," Oh, dear.  Shall we like that?",1
Ses02F_script01_3_F028," I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",1
Ses02F_impro04_F011," It's just really hard.  I feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me.  You know what I mean?  Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people, it's just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you.  You know?",1
Ses05F_impro06_M016, Of course.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_F016, Why?,1
Ses02F_script01_3_M029," I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.",1
Ses03M_impro06_M022, He's supposed to be my best friend.,1
Ses02M_impro06_M023, Thank you.,1
Ses03M_script01_1_M036, I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_M038," It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,",1
Ses02F_script01_1_M004, No.  I thought it was best to leave him alone.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_M034," I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",1
Ses04F_impro02_F024, Fine.,1
Ses03F_impro06_M010, Some people.,1
Ses05F_script01_1_F030," No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.",1
Ses05F_impro04_F016," Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?",1
Ses03M_script01_1_M025, Because other people will suffer.,1
Ses05F_impro04_F029, I don't know.,1
Ses04M_impro02_F031, I can't do it.,1
Ses04F_script01_2_F017," Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",1
Ses04M_impro06_F019," I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know.",1
Ses02M_script01_1_F005, He cried hard?,1
Ses03M_script02_2_M035, I'm trying to do the best I can.,1
Ses02F_impro02_M001, What--what're we gonna do here?  I can't--I can't do this by myself.  I--,1
Ses01M_script01_2_F012," Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself.",1
Ses03M_script01_1_F005, He cried hard?,1
Ses02F_script02_2_F035, I didn't say that.,1
Ses02F_script02_2_M035," I know, me neither.",1
Ses03F_script01_3_M038, And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M026, For like eight years.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M034," And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made",1
Ses03M_impro06_M032, He is the greatest...everyone liked him.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M015, It's just really weird because he was really young you know and it kind of like...,1
Ses02F_script01_1_F014," To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you?",1
Ses03M_impro06_M013, And the car that he hit was his family.,1
Ses04F_impro02_M012, I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.,1
Ses03F_impro02_F016," I know, but look, I have to take this. I mean, if I don't, I mean, I could get fired.",1
Ses03M_impro02_M024, Honey after a year I can be back.,1
Ses03M_script03_1_F018, That's serious enough.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M025, Umm...,1
Ses05M_script01_1_M006, I guess he is.,1
Ses05M_script01_3_M030," I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.",1
Ses02F_script01_3_M003, Oh.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_F005, He cried hard?,1
Ses04F_impro02_F000, Yeah.  They just called.,1
Ses03F_impro02_F026," No, I have to go.",1
Ses02F_script01_1_F039," Tell me, you'd leave the business?",1
Ses01M_script01_3_M023, I don't know.,1
Ses03F_script01_3_F030, How many?,1
Ses01M_impro06_F016, Mmhmm.,1
Ses03M_impro02_F036, You're smart.  You could go back to school--,1
Ses05F_script01_1_M005, I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,1
Ses04M_impro06_F016," Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.",1
Ses02M_script01_3_M023, I don't know how to start.,1
Ses05M_script01_3_F023, How many?,1
Ses03M_script02_2_M034, No.  I know.  Me neither.,1
Ses04M_script01_3_M032," There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",1
Ses05M_script01_2_F016, Just don't stop believing.,1
Ses02M_impro06_M017," just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.",1
Ses04F_script01_3_F019," No.  What is it Chris, your mother?",1
Ses01M_script02_2_M042, I'm doing the best I can.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M007, Yeah.,1
Ses03M_impro06_F007, What happened?  What went wrong?,1
Ses04M_script01_3_F021," Yeah, sure.",1
Ses01M_script01_3_M041, I want you to know Annie.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M023," What am I supposed--oh, one out of five people aren't coming back.",1
Ses03M_impro02_F022," and watch our child grow, see her take her first steps, her first words.",1
Ses01M_script01_3_M027, Pretty much all.,1
Ses03F_impro04_F015," I don't know. I don't know anything other than this, though, is the problem. This is my life. This is what I built everything about, you know.",1
Ses03M_impro02_F016, I can't do this.,1
Ses01M_script01_3_M011, I'm sorry I don't really have much of an imagination.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M027, What the...what am I doing?,1
Ses04M_impro06_M014, I don't know what to do.,1
Ses05F_impro06_F017," Yeah, I'm just going to miss him.",1
Ses02F_impro02_F009, You can just remember it for me.,1
Ses05F_impro06_M001," Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?",1
Ses04F_impro02_M024," I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?",1
Ses05M_impro06_F006, You guys have been-,1
Ses03F_impro06_F034," I never told him, I love you, but-",1
Ses02F_impro06_F000," Um, Johnny died yesterday.",1
Ses04M_impro06_M017, Yeah.,1
Ses02F_script01_3_M005," The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set.",1
Ses03M_script01_3_M029, Just about all.,1
Ses01M_impro06_F003, I'm sorry to hear that.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M009, And he just took it overboard.,1
Ses03M_impro02_M018, What am I supposed to do?,1
Ses05F_impro06_F021," It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...",1
Ses01M_script01_3_M034," I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...",1
Ses02M_script01_3_F018," No.  What is it, Chris. Your mother?",1
Ses05M_impro06_M000, I just got some bad news.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_M040," cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.",1
Ses01M_script01_1_F005, Cried hard?,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M045, I guess that included you.,1
Ses05F_script01_3_M029," I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.",1
Ses01M_script01_1_M004, No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.,1
Ses03M_impro06_M017," -do I miss him or do I hate him, you know?",1
Ses03M_script01_3_F032, Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris.,1
Ses02F_script01_3_M023," It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",1
Ses01M_impro02_M013, I guess you're just going to have to have it without me.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M014, I have to work.,1
Ses04M_script01_3_F004, You saw that and then you've been kind of--,1
Ses04F_script01_1_F004, Did you talk to him?,1
Ses02F_impro06_F011, I'm gonna forget him.,1
Ses03F_impro02_M008, Amy's starting school in a month.,1
Ses05F_script01_3_M039," I I want you now, Annie.",1
Ses02F_script01_3_M028," They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",1
Ses05M_script01_1_M000, He saw it.,1
Ses03M_script01_1_M000, He saw it.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_F008, He's getting just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?,1
Ses02M_script01_1_F006," What was he doing out here at that hour? He's dreaming about him again, he's walking around at night.",1
Ses02F_impro04_F005, I just keep getting rejected.  I just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can't get a job.,1
Ses02M_impro05_M009, It's worth a lot.,1
Ses05F_script01_3_F020, It wouldn't work like this.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M026, There's so many things mixed up.,1
Ses02F_script01_1_M005, I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,1
Ses05F_script01_3_F022, how many?,1
Ses01M_impro02_F015, It's not the same though.,1
Ses04M_script01_3_F007," From her point of view, why else would I come?",1
Ses04F_impro02_F009, And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.,1
Ses05M_script01_1_M014," Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",1
Ses04F_script01_3_M044, Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.,1
Ses05F_script03_1_F020," Well, that's rather serious, isn't it?",1
Ses03F_impro04_F023," Yeah, I guess I could.",1
Ses02M_script01_1_M035," If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.",1
Ses05M_script01_3_F020, You have to tell me.,1
Ses02M_impro04_M010," Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else.",1
Ses05M_script02_2_M030, I'm trying the best I can.,1
Ses05F_script01_3_F011, I almost got married two years ago.,1
Ses05F_script01_3_M035," It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.",1
Ses02M_impro02_F013," Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear.",1
Ses02M_script01_3_M025," Well, I lost them.",1
Ses04F_script01_1_F020, Well you want to make sure that father isn't going to-,1
Ses03F_script01_3_M041," Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.",1
Ses01M_script01_1_M016, You know.,1
Ses04F_impro06_M008, Yeah.,1
Ses05F_script02_2_F017, I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.,1
Ses05M_script01_2_F013," Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",1
Ses05F_script01_1_F032, Give it some more thought.,1
Ses04F_script01_3_M032, I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.,1
Ses02M_impro06_F014," It's going to be okay, I promise.",1
Ses05M_script01_1_M001, He was out here when it broke.,1
Ses02M_script03_2_M025, I imagine you let him kiss you good deal more then.,1
Ses03F_impro04_F018," I just, I need a break. I need something to break me out.",1
Ses02M_impro06_F004," It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry.",1
Ses01M_impro02_M001, I have to go back.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_M014," Then he's gone forever, you sure?",1
Ses05F_impro06_M021, yeah.,1
Ses01M_script01_3_F027," 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you have a right to...",1
Ses02M_impro06_F012, Even if you still do she'll- she'll be there.,1
Ses03F_impro06_M013, We need more people like him.,1
Ses05F_impro06_F013," It must be really, really hard to lose a child.",1
Ses01F_script03_1_F018," Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",1
Ses05F_script02_2_F024, I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.,1
Ses03M_script01_1_F046, Yeah.  I can see that.,1
Ses02F_script02_2_F029, This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,1
Ses01M_impro06_M022," He was a really, really good guy.",1
Ses05F_script03_1_F017," Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",1
Ses01M_script01_3_M040, I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.,1
Ses02M_script01_3_F020, You've gotta tell me.,1
Ses01F_impro06_F022, She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.,1
Ses03M_script01_3_M028, Well I lost them.,1
Ses05F_impro02_M040," I don't Okay.  Okay, we can do this.  We can do this.  It's okay.  We'll make it work.",1
Ses03M_script02_2_F005, It's just...,1
Ses05M_script01_1b_F000, What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,1
Ses05M_impro06_M001," My friend, Shotty, passed away.",1
Ses05F_script02_2_M016," Wait a minute, I got it.",2
Ses03F_script01_3_M004, What?,2
Ses02F_impro08_M018, All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.,2
Ses05F_impro08_F005, Uh- when's when's-,2
Ses04F_impro08_F006," Can you be a little more specific, sir?",2
Ses04M_impro08_M020," I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.",2
Ses05M_impro07_F010, No.,2
Ses02M_script03_2_M024," Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?",2
Ses05F_script01_1_F001, How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.,2
Ses05F_script01_1_F024," Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.",2
Ses03M_script02_2_M044, Are you still cold?  Do you want to go home?,2
Ses02F_script02_2_M017," Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--",2
Ses04F_impro04_M017," 'Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And-",2
Ses03M_impro08b_M007," Well, um- okay.  Your sim card is in- didn't fall out-",2
Ses03M_script03_2_F018, No it isn't.,2
Ses01M_script03_2_M018, Are you going out somewhere dear?,2
Ses02F_impro08_F025, Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.,2
Ses05M_impro07_F032, yeah.,2
Ses01F_impro04_M015," No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--",2
Ses03M_impro08b_M010, Okay.  How about this we'll send you a brand new camera phone with palm pilot-- and-,2
Ses02M_script02_2_M021," Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?",2
Ses05M_impro04_F008," L.A. is really hard.  I mean, have you tried like just going into a bar a couple of times to make friends with people who work there? and",2
Ses02M_script02_2_M016," ""the Grunion are running tonight,"" I said ""great, let's go, I feel lucky,""",2
Ses02M_impro05_F007," Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.",2
Ses05F_impro05_F010, Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.,2
Ses05M_impro08_M020," Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --",2
Ses03F_impro07_M033," Well, get used to it.",2
Ses05F_impro08_F013, All right. I-,2
Ses02M_script02_1_F000, Fine.,2
Ses02F_impro08_M008, Okay. So--,2
Ses01F_impro03_M021," like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.",2
Ses02M_script01_2_M007, You can't read her mind.,2
Ses05M_impro04_F035," Well, um, is that kinda like the side of you that you let people see when you go into these job interviews?",2
Ses05F_impro08_F010," So is it, is- is it at all possible that maybe this statement is just old and that the transaction hadn't been processed yet?",2
Ses05F_script02_2_M002, It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,2
Ses01M_script03_2_M034, This is no time a year for Tunis.,2
Ses01M_impro04_F022, I'm just saying that maybe you should take in some information before you produce more of your own.,2
Ses05M_impro06_F001, What?,2
Ses03M_script03_2_M000, Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,2
Ses04M_script01_1_F004, Did you talk to him?,2
Ses02F_impro08_M006, [BREATHING] that's good.,2
Ses04M_impro08_F028," call up the Sprint call center and, uh, you know. cool",2
Ses05F_impro05_M031," Well, my hands are really tied then.",2
Ses04M_script02_1_M008," I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?",2
Ses05F_impro04_M029, Are you presenting-,2
Ses01F_script02_1_F004, That's not your flashlight.,2
Ses04F_impro07_M060, I just said the library,2
Ses02F_impro08_F012," Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.",2
Ses02F_script02_2_M005," Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",2
Ses03M_impro04_M039, Twenty-one hundred on my S.A.T..,2
Ses02F_script02_2_M033," Yes, it is.",2
Ses01M_impro05_F001, I need a little more information.,2
Ses04M_impro08_M021, Sure.,2
Ses03M_impro03_F018, Isn't it a rat?  It's a rat.  Chuck E. Cheese?,2
Ses01M_script01_2_M003, How do you know he's even thinking about it?,2
Ses01F_script03_1_M035, I did not hit you very hard.,2
Ses02F_script02_2_M020," Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?",2
Ses01M_script02_2_F025, No.,2
Ses02F_impro01_M004, um Sorry.,2
Ses02F_impro05_M020," All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person.",2
Ses01F_script03_2_M001, However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,2
Ses05M_impro08_F015, Okay.,2
Ses05F_impro05_M033," Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?",2
Ses01F_script02_1_F000, Fine.,2
Ses01M_script01_3_F001, Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.,2
Ses01F_script01_2_M001, Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.,2
Ses04M_impro01_F001," Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you?",2
Ses02M_impro08_F010," Okay, it was um- at the [GARBAGE] sorry, it was at a department store, I think it was Macy's or something",2
Ses04F_impro07_M071," Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by",2
Ses05M_impro04_M033, It's that simple.,2
Ses05F_impro08_F027, ahh one eight hundred three two three,2
Ses05M_impro03_F006, uh-huh,2
Ses02M_impro05_F004," Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-",2
Ses04M_impro07_M043, Well I need to defend myself from,2
Ses02M_impro01_F003," I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry.",2
Ses03M_impro08b_M018, They might only have orange.,2
Ses05M_impro04_F004, Right.,2
Ses04F_impro04_M016, Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong.,2
Ses05F_script02_1_F008, There is no point in coming out here.,2
Ses02M_impro08_M023, it's a different number and everything,2
Ses02M_impro05_F023," Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-",2
Ses04M_script01_1_F027, How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,2
Ses03M_impro04_F018," Just for a little bit, you know?  Cause I-I guarantee you're going to find something.  When you find something it's just going to be huge and you're going to get money.",2
Ses01M_script01_3_M014, Why didn't you?,2
Ses02F_impro08_F002, I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes.,2
Ses04M_impro08_M023," No, no, no, it's cool.  It's cool.  It's cool.  So, um",2
Ses02M_script03_2_M010, I have a little I think.,2
Ses04M_script01_1_F005, He cried hard?,2
Ses04F_script03_1_F012, Who's they?,2
Ses03M_impro04_F016," Well it doesn't make any sense though.  Like, with a Harvard degree you should be able to--",2
Ses02F_impro08_M012, All right.  And can they like all get together?,2
Ses04M_impro05_F001, Mmhmm.,2
Ses03M_impro08a_M012," Um- Let me connect you to my supervisor.  Actually, he's out right now so I'm supervisor until he comes back. Um-",2
Ses04F_impro03_M021, I know but you just asked me to-,2
Ses04F_script02_1_M017, That's my point too.,2
Ses04M_script02_2_F015, Do you remember the first time we came to see it?,2
Ses03F_impro07_M025, We should uh- go to Little Ethiopia.,2
Ses04M_impro06_F018," I don't have any magic answers.  But,",2
Ses04M_impro05_F009," That's our policy, sir.",2
Ses01F_impro04_M036, Why not?,2
Ses01F_impro06_M004, Hmm.,2
Ses04M_script01_2_F001, Why does that bother you?,2
Ses04M_impro08_M028, Alright. Take Care.,2
Ses05F_script02_1_M014, Right.,2
Ses01M_impro03_F017, I don't know get it in cash.,2
Ses02F_impro08_M015," Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--",2
Ses02F_impro08_F016, Great.  How many seats?,2
Ses01M_impro04_F012, No.,2
Ses05F_impro04_F041," Bartending, catering.",2
Ses01M_impro07_F012, Oh. Venice beach.,2
Ses04F_impro07_M016, they have that as a major?,2
Ses05F_impro04_M001," Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?",2
Ses02F_impro08_F003," Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight?",2
Ses01F_impro04_M001, Yeah.,2
Ses05F_impro04_M025," You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.",2
Ses02M_impro04_F005," I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh",2
Ses02F_impro08_M016," And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel.",2
Ses02F_script02_1_M019, Right.,2
Ses04F_impro03_M000, What?  You seem so excited.,2
Ses01F_impro04_M023," I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.",2
Ses05F_impro02_F000," baby, I need you to sit down.",2
Ses05M_script03_1_F031, You knew there was nothing in that.,2
Ses05M_impro08_M011," Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button?",2
Ses05M_script01_3_F006," I figured they would, your mother at least.",2
Ses05F_script01_1_F017, Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?,2
Ses01F_impro06_F007, So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.,2
Ses04F_script02_2_M019, Wait a minute.  I've got it.,2
Ses01M_script03_1_M035, It was a horrible thing I hated it.,2
Ses01M_impro04_F011, No.  I'm just saying though that if I was a person who was hiring somebody I-- --would not hire someone who was angry or upset.,2
Ses04M_impro05_F031, The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with.,2
Ses01F_impro04_M021," Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.",2
Ses01F_script02_2_M016," Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.",2
Ses03F_impro04_M006, we're just pooling our funds together.,2
Ses03F_script02_1_M012, Are you cold? Do you want my jacket?,2
Ses01F_script02_2_M002, About what I was saying.,2
Ses05M_impro04_F003, What have you been trying?,2
Ses05M_impro08_F006," Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.",2
Ses03F_impro02_M000, All right.,2
Ses04M_script01_1_M032," Yeah, let's keep going.",2
Ses01F_impro06_M005, Oh.  She was there?,2
Ses05F_impro08_M021, Because I paid it on time.,2
Ses04M_impro05_F000," Hi, how can I help you?",2
Ses03F_script01_3_M026," No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.",2
Ses04M_impro08_M008, So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.,2
Ses04F_script02_2_F025, No.,2
Ses03F_impro04_M004, you got to do.,2
Ses04F_script02_2_M047, It's not champagne.,2
Ses04M_script02_1_M027, We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there.  What's that?  Is that -,2
Ses01M_impro07_F010, Oh.,2
Ses01M_impro05_F016, I had nothing to do with the boarding attendance.  I'm sorry that your seat was wherever it was.,2
Ses01F_script03_2_F004, I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,2
Ses05M_impro08_M025, Uh huh Uh huh We want you to be happy.  You're our customer.  You're the most important thing. Okay?,2
Ses05F_script01_2_M000, Why does that bother you?,2
Ses05M_impro04_M009, yeah.,2
Ses03F_script03_2_F005," Well, what of it?",2
Ses02M_script03_2_F002, No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.,2
Ses04M_impro01_M012," Can I pay you money?  Can I give you, like, twenty bucks and you'll go back there and get the form?",2
Ses03F_impro05_M007," You know, we'll file a complaint and we could possibly, you know, replace some of the things. I think-",2
Ses01F_script02_1_F002, What?,2
Ses03M_impro05b_F018, What is your business?,2
Ses03M_script01_3_M004, What?,2
Ses03M_script01_1_M017," You know why I asked Annie here, right?",2
Ses02F_impro08_F023, Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.,2
Ses03M_impro05a_F001," Well, let me just check on that for you.  Where are you coming--?",2
Ses03M_impro08a_M023, Well I'm sure maybe there's a phone at work you could use.,2
Ses05M_script03_1_F011, Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,2
Ses03M_impro02_M012, Honey you're not going to be by yourself--,2
Ses02M_script02_2_M044, You still cold? Do you want my jacket? Do you want to go home?,2
Ses04M_impro07_M042," 'cause, you know, I mean, it's like If I ever want to go south of campus",2
Ses05M_script03_2_F004," Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.",2
Ses02M_script02_1_F020, That's the wind.,2
Ses04M_impro07_M036, Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. No way.,2
Ses01F_script02_1_M018, Do you want my jacket?,2
Ses05F_impro08_F000," Hi, sir.  How can I help you?",2
Ses05F_impro08_M027, three two three,2
Ses01F_impro04_M031, I don't think I'm anyone.,2
Ses05F_script02_1_F018, We didn't see them the first time either.,2
Ses05F_impro04_M013, Have you?  There's got to be something else.,2
Ses02M_script02_1_M021, No. No. That's not my point. The point is there is no point in coming down here if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?,2
Ses01F_impro04_M004, I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.,2
Ses05M_script03_2_F026, You always had a weak head.,2
Ses05F_script03_1_M030," Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.",2
Ses05M_script03_2_M024," So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?",2
Ses02F_script02_2_M007," There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.",2
Ses04M_impro05_F003, Right.,2
Ses05F_impro05_M001, On what airline?,2
Ses05F_impro04_M024, You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.,2
Ses05M_impro03_F000, what?,2
Ses03F_script03_2_F017," It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?",2
Ses03F_script01_2_M006, You can't read her mind.,2
Ses02F_script03_2_M001, I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,2
Ses01M_script03_1_M005, Yes... Hello?  Hello?  I'm sorry what's that?,2
Ses03F_impro07_M001, I'm all right.,2
Ses05F_impro08_F002," [LAUGHTER] All right.  I'm sorry, sir that you've been having a hard time.",2
Ses05M_impro04_M029, I can juggle.,2
Ses03M_impro05b_F030, Some refreshments in the lobby?,2
Ses05M_script01_3_M003, Well-,2
Ses01M_script01_3_M002, Why not?,2
Ses02F_script01_1_F026, [BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?,2
Ses05F_script02_1_F007," It's after eleven, let's go home.",2

Ses05M_impro03_F030, Oooh,2
Ses02F_impro04_M008," I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--",2

Ses04F_script03_1_M028, The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,2

Ses03M_impro04_F028, Well obviously it's not working.  Just cause you got sixteen hundred on your S.A.T. doesn't guarantee you a job.  I mean it should really but--,2
Ses02M_impro01_M001," Yea. I just want to get this done,",2
Ses01F_impro04_M013, It's kind of helpful when getting a job.,2
Ses04M_script02_1_M016," No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",2
Ses05F_impro05_M007, I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.,2

Ses04M_script01_2_M017, Why me above all?,3
Ses03M_script01_1_M042, Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it?,3
Ses05F_impro05_F026, Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?,3
Ses05F_script02_2_M012," It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.",3
Ses01F_script03_2_F017, No it isn't.,3
Ses04F_impro05_F011, Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.,3
Ses05M_script02_1_F018," Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.",3

Ses02M_script03_2_M043, You're not going like this.,3
Ses02F_script01_1_F030, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,3
Ses04F_script01_1_M012, We've got to say it to him.,3
Ses01M_script01_1_F017, Why?,3
Ses03M_impro01_F003, No.  You filled out the back part.  You were supposed to fill out the front portion only.,3
Ses01F_script03_2_M035," Amanda, listen, listen.",3
Ses04M_script01_2_F004, He's not going to marry her.,3
Ses02M_script01_2_M016," What does that mean, me above all?",3
Ses02M_script01_2_F007," Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited.",3
Ses03F_impro08_M012, A free calling card?,3
Ses03M_impro08a_F027," Yeah yeah, woman going out in South Central on the payphone at night.  Oh that's real safe.",3
Ses04F_script03_2_M035, This is no time of year for Tunis.,3

Ses04F_script01_1_M025, To hell with that.,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M030," Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_F016," It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment, won't you?",3
Ses01M_script02_2_M009," Okay, well then what's bugging you?",3
Ses05F_script02_2_F012," For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",3
Ses03F_script02_1_F020, About what?,3
Ses05F_script01_1_M013," For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!",3
Ses01F_script02_2_F011, No they won't.  It's like waiting for Santa Claus.,3
Ses04F_script01_1_M027," Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.",3
Ses05F_impro05_F021," Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.",3
Ses02M_script03_2_F037," Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",3
Ses04M_script01_1_F030," Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_M030," You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.",3
Ses02M_impro01_M014, This is ridiculous. Come on,3
Ses02F_script02_2_F014," For heaven sake, this isn't about fish.",3
Ses05M_impro01_M017, That's crap- You're crap.  I don't buy it.,3
Ses05F_impro05_F039," Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_F024, Mind your own business.,3
Ses05M_script03_2_M045, You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.,3
Ses05F_impro02_M015, It doesn't make any sense.  It's stupid.  I told you you shouldn't go in the Army.,3
Ses04M_script01_1_F026, Did you ask Annie yet?,3
Ses05F_impro02_M017," They're six months old. Six months old, they're tiny.",3
Ses03F_script03_2_F023," I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.",3
Ses04M_impro05_M010," I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy.",3
Ses04M_impro01_M018, It's not rocket science.,3
Ses03M_impro01_F020, Really?,3
Ses04M_script03_2_F000, That was the first time you ever hit me.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M006, What of it?,3
Ses01M_script02_1_F021, Yes.,3
Ses03F_impro05_F011, What? There- There's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_M016, Nothing.,3
Ses05F_script02_1_F002, It's not your flashlight.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_F006," Oh come on, it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't harm me.",3
Ses04F_script01_1_M010, I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M009, So am I.  Bored stiff.  Want some brandy?,3
Ses03F_script02_2_M026," A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?",3
Ses04F_impro04_F025, Well you- just you're doing something wrong.,3
Ses05M_script03_2_F030, Why?,3
Ses04M_script01_1_M009, You know that Larry's not coming back.  And I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,3
Ses01M_impro01_M029," People like me, what is that supposed to mean?  You know, this is ridiculous.  Is there like a manager here, is there someone else that I can talk to?",3
Ses03F_script02_1_F013," I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.",3
Ses03F_script03_2_F026, You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.,3
Ses04F_impro07_M065, Yes.,3
Ses03M_impro01_M015, -- No.  I'm not waiting...I'm not coming back again.  I don't have time to come back five days.,3
Ses04F_impro04_F031, I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M004," You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",3
Ses01M_impro01_M015, So can you help me or not?,3
Ses03M_impro08a_F013," You sign the contract and then down the line the phone doesn't work and you're stuck, you can't go to a new...no.  No contracts for me.  You give me a new phone.",3
Ses01M_script01_1_F018," Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?",3
Ses02F_script03_2_F023," Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.",3
Ses04M_script02_2_F009," We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",3
Ses05F_script03_2_F015, It's the woman's job to allure the man.  Why don't you watch me for a moment?,3
Ses03F_script03_2_F003," No, I didn't. You made that up all in your jealous imagination.",3
Ses04M_impro02_F024," Fine, fine.  We have to be together.  If you can't stay here, then I'll go with you.  I don't care where you go.  We'll go, too.  I'm not staying behind.",3
Ses04M_impro02_F026, Difficult.  You're leaving for a year. We have a newborn child and you're leaving.  I don't think I'm being difficult.,3
Ses05M_script01_1_M039, I am thinking that way.,3
Ses04F_script02_1_F004, You kept saying my flashlight as if it somehow is just yours.  How's that supposed to make me feel?,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M008," Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_M043, You're not.,3
Ses04F_impro01_F019, I'm testing your patience?,3
Ses04M_script03_1_M005," Hello, hello.  What?  Wrong number.",3
Ses01F_impro01_M013, Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_F012, It's become a habit with you.,3
Ses01M_script02_2_F011," I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.",3
Ses03M_script02_2_F013," Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_M001, I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.,3
Ses03M_script02_2_M029, Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.,3
Ses03F_impro05_F012," No, no, no. You don't understand. This is--these are my belongings in the luggage. And I went to Paris.",3
Ses02M_script03_2_M036, This is no time of the year for Tunis.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_M022," Going out somewhere, my dear?",3
Ses03M_impro01_M018, just as I want.  Ugh.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_M036, I'm not in the least drunk.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_F036, Why?,3
Ses03M_impro05a_F027, Sir?,3
Ses05M_script01_1b_M041," No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",3
Ses04F_script01_1_F036, You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,3
Ses03F_script03_2_M040, Very amusing indeed.,3
Ses02M_script03_2_F022, They sting.,3
Ses01M_impro01_F026, Why?,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M019," Yes, it is.",3
Ses03M_impro04_M010, Biomedical Engineering.,3
Ses04F_impro04_F015, extreme request.  I want to find a job.  Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.,3
Ses05M_script01_1b_F025, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,3
Ses01M_script03_2_M040," You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again.",3
Ses03F_script03_2_F016, No. Just making myself fascinating for you.,3
Ses01M_script02_2_F010," Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.",3
Ses05F_script03_2_F036, I- I hate you.,3
Ses03M_script03_2_M023," Hmm, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",3
Ses05F_script03_2_M018," Oh, yes it is.",3
Ses04F_impro08_M019, because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.,3
Ses02F_script03_2_F043, Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.,3
Ses04F_script01_1_M019, Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,3
Ses03M_impro01_M007, You don't know! you can't write?  You don't know how to write?,3
Ses02F_script03_2_M026," Oh, must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all.  Very enjoyable and never had much anyhow.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_F040, This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.,3
Ses04F_script02_2_M032, Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.,3
Ses04F_script01_1_M039," Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.",3
Ses02M_impro01_M015," I cannot go back in that line. I've got stuff I need to do, I mean-",3
Ses04F_script03_2_M037, Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,3
Ses05M_script01_2_F010," I want you to pretend like he's coming back.  Both of you, don't think I haven't noticed you and Chris since she's gotten here.  I don't want any nonsense.",3
Ses05F_script03_2_F041, Beast; brute; cad; whore,3
Ses05F_impro05_F019," No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?",3
Ses04M_script03_2_F012," If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",3
Ses01F_script03_2_M021," Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder.",3
Ses05F_impro01_F022, Are you being straight with me?,3
Ses03M_script01_1_F020," Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.",3
Ses01F_impro04_F033, I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.,3
Ses03M_impro04_M008, I'm smarter than half the people I work for.,3
Ses05M_script03_2_M041," You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.",3
Ses04M_script02_1_F018," Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_F000," Honey, you knew there was nothing in that.",3
Ses04M_script03_2_F023," Oh, be quiet.",3
Ses04F_script03_2_M029, Very interesting and how about a child of six and a child of four and a child of nine.,3
Ses04F_impro04_F009, Nothing I'm trying seems to work. Just-,3
Ses05M_impro01_F023," Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.",3
Ses01M_script03_2_M027," I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.",3
Ses04F_script03_2_F011, seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,3
Ses03M_script01_1_F043," I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.",3
Ses04F_script03_2_F029," Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",3
Ses04M_script01_2_F015, She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--,3
Ses03M_impro05b_M030, Okay.  And you're going to give me what for my inconvenience?,3
Ses04F_script01_1_F044, Yeah.  I can see that.,3
Ses02M_script01_1_M019, No it's not only my business.,3
Ses04M_script02_2_M008, Why not?,3
Ses04M_script01_1_F010, What do you want to do?  Argue with him?,3
Ses04M_script03_2_F051," Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute.",3
Ses04M_impro05_M009," fifty dollars. No way, no.",3
Ses05M_script01_2_F015, You above all have got to believe.,3
Ses04M_script02_2_F006," Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",3
Ses01M_script01_1_F008," He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets.",3
Ses01F_script02_2_F006," Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.",3
Ses04F_impro02_F020, I will but I can't right now.,3
Ses04F_impro04_M032," I'm trying to be helpful and you're just, like, coming at me with, like, attacks.",3
Ses05F_script03_2_F027," Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.",3
Ses01M_script02_2_M033," A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?",3
Ses02M_script03_2_M042," You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",3
Ses03F_script01_2_M013," Why me, above all?",3
Ses02F_script02_1_F002, That's not your flashlight.,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M020," Well, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",3
Ses04M_script01_1_F039, You don't want to think like that.,3
Ses04F_script02_2_F034," Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",3
Ses05M_script01_1_M012, We have to say it to him.,3
Ses01M_script03_2_M020, As matter the fact that's perfectly true.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M017," Ah, that reply has broken my heart.",3
Ses03F_script02_1_F006," It's past eleven, let's go home.",3
Ses03M_script03_2_M011, No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,3
Ses03M_script02_2_F001, It's ridiculous.,3
Ses05F_impro01_M013, Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself.  I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to.,3
Ses03M_impro05a_F018," Sir, I just...you need to calm down is what needs to happen right now.",3
Ses04F_impro05_F008, No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.,3
Ses01M_script01_2_F005, The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.,3
Ses04F_script01_2_F007," She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",3
Ses04F_impro04_F006, What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight.,3
Ses05F_impro02_M014, I don't understand why they would just do something like this?,3
Ses02M_script02_2_M032," 'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.",3
Ses04F_script03_1_M013, All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.,3
Ses01F_impro01_M011, I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.,3
Ses03M_impro05a_F028, What is your name?,3
Ses04M_impro05_M044," Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks.",3
Ses03M_impro08b_F000, Hello.,3
Ses04F_script02_1_M016, Right.,3
Ses05M_script02_2_F002, It's P.R. somebody sold you a bill of goods that this magical thing would be happening on the beach.,3
Ses04M_script01_1_F020, I'm just saying.,3
Ses04M_script02_2_M031," And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",3
Ses04F_script01_1_F012, You can't say that to him.,3
Ses05M_script01_1_M025, To hell with that!,3
Ses03M_script01_2_M015," Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?",3
Ses03F_script03_2_M002, I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.,3
Ses05M_script01_1b_M033," I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_M032," You better turn that off, I think.",3
Ses03M_impro05a_M015, What am I going to do tomorrow without the urn?,3
Ses03M_script02_2_F003," Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.",3
Ses01M_impro01_F000, Next.,3
Ses03M_script02_1_F014," What are you getting so excited about?  I mean, it's not like it's like the landing on the moon or something.  I mean, it's just fish, fish that nobody eats.",3
Ses04M_script03_2_M027, It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,3
Ses02F_script03_2_M039," Amanda, listen. listen",3
Ses05F_script01_2_M016, What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!,3
Ses05F_script03_2_F030, There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,3
Ses04M_script01_1_F018, What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,3
Ses04F_script01_1_F029, I don't see why it has to be Annie.,3
Ses05F_impro05_F018, Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.,3
Ses05M_script03_2_F040," Yes, I am. Let go with me",3
Ses02M_script01_1_M021, See it isn't just my business-,3
Ses02F_script02_1_F016, I'm just not.,3
Ses05M_impro04_M040," Yeah, well thanks for your help.",3
Ses04F_script01_1_F041," because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.",3
Ses05M_script01_2_F001," She's been in New York three and a half years, why all of a sudden?",3
Ses02M_script02_1_F018," Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.",3
Ses03F_script02_2_F007, It's not like that.,3
Ses04M_script01_1_M020, Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it?,3
Ses02F_script03_2_M021," Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",3
Ses03M_impro01_M029, What is wrong with you?,3
Ses04F_script03_2_F010, I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_M055, little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live.,3

Ses02F_impro05_F008," I need my stuff.  It's--I need my stuff.  I mean, uh...",3
Ses02F_script01_1_F015," Trouble is the God damn newspapers.  Every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere so, you know, the next one is gonna be Larry.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_M008," Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",3
Ses01M_script03_2_F012, I just think it's silly you know to go on and on and on about such a thing.,3
Ses02F_script01_1_M025, To hell with that.,3
Ses04M_script01_1_M038," Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.",3

Ses04M_script03_2_M049," You're a vile tempered, loosed living",3
Ses05M_script02_2_M025," Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!",3
Ses02M_script01_1_F033," What the hell is this, are you crazy?",3
Ses04M_script03_2_M023, Oh.  That reply has broken my heart.,3
Ses01F_script02_1_F012, There is no point.,3
Ses01F_impro04_F010, What did he do?  What was so great?  I don't understand why they would pick him over me.,3
Ses04F_impro05_F009," You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.",3
Ses01M_script01_2_F008," Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe.  Her- strangers might but not her father, not her brother.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_M023, They snap.,3
Ses01M_script03_2_F020," Oh, well that's funny.  It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",3
Ses02M_impro05_M025, The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-,3
Ses04F_script03_2_F005, What of it?,3
Ses03F_script03_2_M029, I'm not in the least bit drunk.,3
Ses04F_impro05_F002," I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that?",3
Ses05M_script01_1_M032," I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.",3
Ses03F_script03_2_M044," I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",3
Ses01M_impro01_M013, You're very helpful.  What's your name?,3
Ses02F_script01_1_M012, We've got to say it to him.,3
Ses02F_script03_2_F017," No, it isn't.",3
Ses04F_script02_2_F011, Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.,3
Ses03F_script01_2_F002, You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.,3
Ses04F_impro02_M005, You don't know that.,3
Ses02F_impro01_F018," Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then?",3
Ses01M_script03_2_M021," Yes, it is.",3
Ses02M_script02_1_F012," I don't, it's just stupid.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_M028, I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_F025, You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_M043," Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_F033, They're away in Tunis.,3
Ses01M_impro05_M013," It was right in the middle of five different people.  I had a huge fat lady next me, a crying kid on left I went like can I please get a Bloody Mary, please? Will you bring a Bloody Mary?",3
Ses05M_script02_2_M010," Well, we'll see them this year.",3
Ses03M_script03_2_F044," Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-",3
Ses04F_script03_2_F023," Yes, I did quite a lot.",3
Ses03F_script03_2_M039," Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-",3
Ses04M_script03_2_F016, It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,3
Ses03M_impro04_M007, To be a receptionist?  Oh I spent forty thousand dollar a year for my college degree and I'm a receptionist.  God.,3
Ses04M_script01_1_F022," From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.",3
Ses01M_impro01_F009," Well, do you have your passport?",3
Ses01F_script03_2_F038, This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,3
Ses04M_script02_1_F010, So let's go home.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_M018, That reply has broken my heart.,3
Ses04M_script02_2_M034," No, I know, me neither.",3
Ses03F_impro05_F002," Where? I don't know. The lost and found. What do you mean, lost and found?",3
Ses03M_impro05a_M020, What is the matter with you?,3
Ses02F_script03_2_F029, Shut up.,3
Ses01F_script03_2_F011, I just think it's silly to go on and on and on about such a thing.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M033, It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.,3
Ses01M_script03_2_F034," Turn it on again, please.",3
Ses03M_impro08a_F035," What are you, what are you a police officer now?  You know, like I'm done, I'm over it.  Goodbye and I hope that you lose your job.",3
Ses02F_script01_1_F033," I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.",3
Ses01M_script01_2_F001, It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?,3
Ses05F_impro04_F011, This is humiliating.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M015, Nothing.,3
Ses05F_script01_1_M038, I know that Mom. I know.  Just you help me stay here.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_F026," Adders don't snap, they sting.",3
Ses04F_impro05_F004," Lost it just, like, I mean,",3
Ses01M_script02_1_F000, I'm fine.,3
Ses04F_script02_1_F016, I'm just not.,3

Ses04F_script03_2_F038, Stop.,3
Ses05F_script01_2_M006, You can't read her mind.,3
Ses01M_script01_1_F023, I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.,3
Ses05M_script01_1b_M030," All right then, mom.",3
Ses03M_impro01_M017, Yes I will.  I'll have this [GARBAGE],3
Ses04F_script01_1_F040, Alright but don't think that way,3
Ses03M_impro01_M019, Fine.  Call your supervisor.  Ask supervisor over,3
Ses05M_script03_2_M040, Ja! Very funny.,3
Ses05F_script03_2_F029, Why?,3
Ses04M_script02_2_F025, No.,3
Ses04F_impro04_F007, Okay.  I think three years is a little excessive.,3
Ses02M_script01_1_F037," Well, you don't want to think like that.",3
Ses02F_script01_1_M013," For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",3
Ses03M_impro05b_M014," Okay, so you can put me in Holiday Inn for twenty dollar a night?",3
Ses02M_script01_2_F004, It's got that all about it.,3
Ses03M_impro08a_F000," Hello?  God finally somebody, look, this is ridiculous.  I've been waiting online for like a half an hour now.",3
Ses01F_script03_2_F039, Oh.  Yes I am.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_F035, You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,3
Ses02M_script03_2_F031, There aren't any people upstairs it's a photographer's studio.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_M037, I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M024, Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?,3
Ses04F_script02_1_F009, That's my point.,3
Ses05M_impro01_M021, I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form!,3
Ses02F_script01_1_F024," And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?",3
Ses03M_script02_1_F012, I don't know.  I just don't.,3
Ses04F_script01_1_F028, The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,3
Ses05M_script02_1_F012, it's stupid.,3
Ses01F_script02_1_F022," Last time, you'll also remember, we got our shoes wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat and we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",3
Ses05F_script01_1_M028," So what, I'm not fast with women.",3
Ses01F_script02_2_M030," Well welcome to the human race, huh?  Do you think I had some grand fantasy going that four years down the line we would come to this beach and be arguing over fish?  No.",3
Ses05M_script01_3_M038," you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.",3
Ses05F_impro01_F018, Why not?,3
Ses03F_script03_2_F022, They sting.,3
Ses01M_script02_1_F003, That's not your flashlight.,3
Ses05M_script01_1b_F036," Don't think like that, do you hear me?",3
Ses01F_script02_2_F016," For God's sake, this is not about fish.",3
Ses04F_script01_1_M021, Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.,3
Ses04F_impro01_M011, You're going to have to go back again.,3
Ses01F_script03_2_M023, Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,3
Ses04F_script01_1_F032, You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?,3
Ses01M_script02_1_F023, We didn't see them the year before either.,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M039, Turn it off.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_M038, Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?,3
Ses02M_script02_2_F009," Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.",3
Ses02M_script01_1_M031," I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.",3
Ses01F_script03_2_F014, What?,3
Ses05F_impro01_F019," Except they're going tell, are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least?",3
Ses03M_impro01_F017, Sir-,3
Ses04F_script02_1_F006, I'm cold.,3
Ses01M_script02_1_F024, That's the wind.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_F021, They sting.,3
Ses01M_impro01_M030, Why?,3
Ses04M_impro01_F019, Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?,3
Ses05M_script01_1b_M038," Well, you help me stay here.",3
Ses03M_impro02_F035," Priorities honey, priorities.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_M038, Turn it off.,3
Ses04F_script01_1_F027, How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_F049," Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like.",3
Ses05F_script03_2_F033," Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent.",3
Ses02M_impro05_M007, there are- I have important things in that bag. I've got,3
Ses04F_impro08_M024," attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_M044, oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M023, They snap.,3
Ses04F_impro08_M015," and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you.",3
Ses04F_script02_1_F007, It's after eleven let's go home.,3
Ses03M_script01_1_F024, She's not...she's Larry's girl.,3
Ses05M_script01_1b_F038," Yeah, I can see that.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_M026," I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.",3
Ses04F_impro01_M024," I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?",3
Ses01M_script03_2_M030," Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots.",3
Ses01M_script01_1_M034, Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,3
Ses01M_impro01_F007," No, I need your ID to give you a second ID.",3
Ses03M_impro05a_M011, Eight.  And they're all gone.,3
Ses03M_impro05b_M012, Tonight no.  I'm driving tomorrow.  Tonight I'm staying with a friend alright?  I don't need hotel reservations...where?  What hotel?,3
Ses04M_script02_2_F001, About what?,3
Ses03F_script03_2_F020," Well, it didn't seem to do such wonders with you, now did it?",3
Ses01M_script02_1_F012, There is no point.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M040, Very amusing.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_F019, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,3
Ses04F_impro01_M008, There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing.,3
Ses03F_script02_2_M032, Right.,3
Ses04M_script02_2_F030," This is just this.  I mean, it includes a lot and everything, but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",3
Ses03F_script03_2_F012, I don't see what's the point of going on and on about something like this.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_M022," Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",3
Ses01F_script02_2_F001, About what?,3
Ses02F_script03_2_M037, Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,3
Ses02F_script03_2_M034, There are people downstairs I suppose?,3
Ses03F_script03_2_F000, You knew there was nothing in that.,3
Ses02M_script01_1_M025, To hell with that.,3
Ses05F_impro02_M010, Where do you have to go?  Where are you going?,3
Ses02F_script02_2_M008, Why not?,3
Ses03M_impro05b_M020," You misplace a lot of, eight pieces of luggage.",3
Ses04F_script02_1_F019, We didn't see them the first time either.,3
Ses03F_script01_2_M017, What have I got to hide?,3
Ses03M_script01_2_F000, Why did he invite her here?,3
Ses03M_script02_2_M028, Welcome to the human race.,3
Ses05F_impro05_F036," So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?",3
Ses05M_script01_1_M033," But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.",3
Ses01M_script03_2_F016," No, darling I'm just making myself fascinating for you.",3
Ses01M_impro01_M033," Oh, no honey. And you're going to miss the Christmas card too. It's a shame. It's going to be a good, nice picture.",3
Ses02M_script02_2_F003," Yea, sure everyone was sold the same story. I mean it keeps us all excited, keeps us coming back for more, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot.",3
Ses03M_script03_2_M024, Yes they do.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,3
Ses02M_script03_2_M039, Turn it off.,3
Ses01M_script02_2_F030, I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,3
Ses02F_script02_2_M029," Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?",3
Ses04F_impro01_M005, I've got a life too ma'am,3
Ses05M_script03_2_F007," Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it.",3
Ses05F_impro01_F014," No, they did.  The lady over there told me to stand in this line and I've been here for an hour.",3
Ses05M_impro01_M022," This is crap.  You know, I don't even know why I'm in this state.  Screw California.  I'm out of here.",3
Ses01F_script03_2_M020," Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_F035," Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",3
Ses02M_script03_2_F013, Don't be so stupid.,3
Ses01M_impro04_M007, Do I have an attitude problem?,3
Ses02M_script02_2_M034, Right.,3
Ses03F_script02_2_M033," No, I know. Me neither.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_F020," Adders don't snap, they sting.",3
Ses02M_impro01_M011," I filled out the application right, didn't I?",3
Ses04F_script01_2_F003, She's not going to marry him.,3
Ses01M_script01_2_F006, Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men probably a hundred people told her she is crazy but she is waited.,3
Ses05F_impro05_F034, You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-,3
Ses05M_impro01_F018," Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form.",3
Ses05M_script01_1_M037," Well, you help me stay here.",3
Ses01M_script03_2_F011, I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.,3
Ses04F_impro08_M017, You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.,3
Ses05M_script01_1b_M022, what to hell with that!,3
Ses03M_script01_1_F042, Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M021," Nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",3
Ses05F_script03_2_M011," No particular reason, besides, they were very small ones.",3
Ses02M_script02_1_F014, What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.,3
Ses03M_script01_2_F006, No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.,3
Ses05M_script03_2_F024, [LAUGHTER] Mind your own business.,3
Ses03M_script03_2_F031," On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.",3
Ses01F_script03_2_F029," Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.",3
Ses05F_script03_2_M036, I'll do no such thing.,3
Ses05M_script02_2_M027," Yes, it is.",3
Ses05F_script01_2_F006, She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.,3
Ses01M_script01_1_F029, I don't see why it has to be Annie.,3
Ses01F_script01_2_F006, She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.,3
Ses02M_script03_2_M046, Shut up.,3
Ses04M_impro01_F021, Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.,3
Ses05F_impro05_F040," Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.",3
Ses02F_script02_2_F002, It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach.,3
Ses05F_script03_2_F025," Oh no, on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.",3
Ses04F_script03_2_F034, Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,3
Ses03M_script02_2_M032, Yes it is.,3
Ses03M_script02_2_F033, Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_F013," Oh, don't be so stupid.",3
Ses05F_script03_2_M027, I'm not the least bit drunk.,3
Ses05F_impro05_F032," No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is.",3
Ses04M_script01_2_M019," What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",3
Ses04M_script03_2_M047, Turn it off.,3
Ses04F_impro08_M004, and now I'm talking to you.  And all I want is my money back.  That's all I'm asking for. It's not much.,3
Ses05F_script01_2_F014," Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.",3
Ses03M_impro01_M025, Do you own the D.M.V.?,3
Ses03M_script03_2_M035, Because people upstairs will get annoyed.,3
Ses05M_script01_1_F035," All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.",3
Ses05F_script01_2_F004, It's got that about it.,3
Ses01M_script01_1_F016, The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--,3
Ses05M_script03_2_M035, This is no time of the year for Tunis.,3
Ses01M_script03_2_M023," You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.",3
Ses03F_script02_2_F012, Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.,3
Ses02M_impro05_M019," so if it's back there or something, if there is something you can do",3
Ses01M_impro01_F017," What... well, do you have a driver's license?",3
Ses05F_script01_1_F022," As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead and you've no right to take his girl.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_M028," As I mentioned before, I have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_M008," Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",3
Ses05M_script01_2_M009," Well, what do you want me to do about it?  What do you want?",3
Ses05F_script01_1_F036, Must you be inspired?,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M042," You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again.",3
Ses04F_impro08_M023," Cindy, look.  If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check",3
Ses03M_impro08a_F012," No, no, no...  I'm done with these contract business because this is what can happen.",3
Ses03M_script02_2_M006," There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home.",3
Ses03F_script03_2_M038, Turn it off.,3
Ses05M_script01_1_M035, I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M019, It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,3
Ses05F_impro05_F038, This is ridiculous.,3
Ses03F_script01_2_M014, Huh?,3
Ses03M_impro05b_M024, in all thousand flights I've been on probably I can't even count how many flights I've been on.  This has never happened before.,3
Ses04F_script02_2_M033," No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our",3
Ses02F_script01_1_F034, I just--give it some more thought.,3
Ses02M_script02_2_M029," Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?",3
Ses03M_impro05b_M016, Soon as you...that's not good enough okay?,3
Ses03M_impro05b_M029, Can you get it to the San Diego airport?  You get someone to drive it to my place alright? Then I get a refund for some...I get a free flight alright? I get free whatever.,3
Ses04M_script01_1_M017, You know why.,3
Ses04F_impro08_F023, But I'm giving you what you want.,3
Ses04M_script02_1_F002, It's not yours.,3
Ses05M_script01_1b_M034," I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.  I'm through with it.",3
Ses03F_script03_2_M023," Yes, they do. They have a big bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",3
Ses03M_impro02_F007, For how long this time?,3
Ses03F_script02_1_F007, There is no point in coming down here.,3
Ses03F_impro08_M020, A day's worth of business.  You know how much I make in a day?,3
Ses03M_impro01_F014, No.  You couldn't go get another one.,3
Ses01F_script01_2_F007," Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.",3
Ses03M_impro05a_M001, Yeah.  You do that.  I'm coming from Baltimore.  You know where that is?,3
Ses03M_impro04_M003, Last time someone told me I was too qualified.,3
Ses04M_script02_2_F004, Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.,3
Ses04F_script01_2_F002, Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,3
Ses01M_script01_1_M041, I am thinking like that.,3
Ses03M_impro04_M009, I don't know astronaut?  I don't know something crazy like that.,3
Ses05F_impro08_M007," Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.",3
Ses02M_script02_1_F003, It's ours; it's mine too.,3
Ses01M_script03_2_F038," listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.",3
Ses03F_script01_2_F015," Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.",3
Ses03F_script03_2_F037, I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.,3
Ses01M_impro05_M027," Sure, yeah right you have plenty of aggressive searching going on, aggressive searching, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes.",3
Ses05M_script02_2_F009," Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever",3
Ses02M_script02_2_F014, For heavens sake this isn't about fish.,3
Ses04M_impro02_F030, I'm not going to stay here and wait.,3
Ses02M_script01_1_F036," Tell me, you'd leave the business?",3
Ses04F_script03_2_F027," On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",3
Ses05F_script01_1_F041," Yeah, I can see that.",3
Ses02F_script01_1_F031," Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_M025," You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?",3
Ses04F_impro05_F005, it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention,3
Ses04M_script03_2_M010, You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,3
Ses05F_script02_1_F003, It's ours- our flashlight.  It's yours and mine.,3
Ses05M_script03_2_F025, You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.,3
Ses02M_script03_2_M003, You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3
Ses01M_impro05_M007, You people have just been tossing me around like a used hanky.,3
Ses02F_script03_2_F042, I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.,3
Ses01F_script03_2_M007, What about me?,3
Ses04F_script02_2_M007," There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",3
Ses04M_script03_2_M005, I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,3
Ses05F_script02_2_F005," God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.",3
Ses05F_impro05_F017, Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?,3
Ses01F_script03_2_M024," And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.",3
Ses05F_impro01_F021, Do you have a manager I could speak with?,3
Ses03F_impro05_F007," What do you mean, if it shows up? No, I need it now. I have my keys, I have my wallet, I have my money. I have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.",3
Ses04M_script02_1_F015, This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,3
Ses04M_impro05_M011, You understand?,3
Ses02M_impro05_M023," Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on",3

Ses05F_script03_2_F021," I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.",3
Ses05F_impro05_F029," So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it.",3
Ses03F_script03_2_F002, Not at all. It was very pretty. And I wear it all the time. I still have it.,3
Ses05F_script02_1_F013," Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.",3

Ses01M_impro01_F030, Sit back down.,3
Ses01M_script03_2_M029, I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.,3
Ses02F_script03_2_M042, You're not going like this.,3

Ses05F_script03_2_F032, Turn it on again.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_M019, You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,3

Ses01M_script03_2_M032, Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.,3
Ses05M_script01_1_F011, You can't say that to him.,3
Ses05M_impro01_M019," Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D.",3
Ses03M_impro08b_F005," Yeah, yeah, yeah you better be sorry.",3
Ses01F_script03_2_F013, Don't be stupid.,3
Ses03M_script03_2_M046, Oh.,3

Ses03F_script03_2_M027," I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?",3
Ses02M_script02_1_F004, But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel?,3
Ses04F_script02_2_F002, It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,3

Ses02M_script01_1_F022," You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?",3
Ses02F_script03_2_F027, You've always had a weak head.,3

Ses04M_script01_1_F036, You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,3
Ses02M_script01_1_F034, What about the business? What is this?,3
Ses02F_script03_2_M032," You better turn that off, I think.",3
Ses02M_impro04_M004," I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know.",3
Ses03M_script02_2_M007, Why not?,3
Ses05F_script01_1_M036," Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long, I like to come home to something beautiful.  I want a family.  I want- I want kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. and Annie is in the center of that, and now where do I find it?",3
Ses05M_script02_2_F008, We We don't ever.  Have we ever?,3
Ses04F_script01_1_F019, What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,3
Ses04F_impro07_M064, It's important.,3
Ses03M_script02_1_F002, It's not your flashlight.,3
Ses03F_script01_2_F007, Then why is she married? Then why isn't she married? She's been in New York and there's hundreds of single men there.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_M052," No, you're not.",3
Ses04M_script01_2_M009, You can't read her mind.,3
Ses05M_script01_1b_M035, The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,3
Ses03M_script03_2_M015, Really Amanda.,3
Ses03M_script02_1_M044, It certainly is not.  It's,3
Ses02M_script03_2_M001, I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_F031, There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,3
Ses05M_impro01_M018, I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.,3
Ses03M_impro08a_F029," We can't call out.  We can't make out-- line.  I don't work, I work at another office.",3
Ses01M_script02_1_F004," It's ours; it's my flashlight, too.",3
Ses03M_script03_2_M012, Oh my...just because I just...okay...,3
Ses01F_script03_2_F027, Oh shut up.,3
Ses05F_script01_2_F012," Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?",3
Ses04M_script01_2_F002," She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--",3
Ses02M_script01_1_F026," Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",3
Ses03M_impro05b_M032," Thanks you, thank you I don't have my luggage so you gave me a Holiday Inn stay and peanuts.  Wow.  You know what?",3
Ses03F_script03_2_M028, You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.,3
Ses05M_script01_2_M006, You don't know.  You can't read her mind.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M007, What about me?,3
Ses03F_script02_1_F012, Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,3
Ses05M_script01_2_F014, Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,3
Ses03M_script02_1_M021," I mean, don't you want to see it?",3
Ses04M_script03_2_M014, So am I; bored stiff.,3
Ses03M_script01_1_M023, She's not Larry's girl.,3
Ses04M_impro08_F017, How long does that take?,3
Ses01M_script03_2_F029, Shut up.,3
Ses01F_impro04_F017, Why?  It's a piece of paper.,3
Ses03M_script03_1_M005, Hello?  Hello?  What?,3
Ses04F_impro04_F020, [LAUGHTER] Yeah.  Usually.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_M026, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,3
Ses05M_script01_1b_F019," As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead.  And she's still his girl.",3
Ses05F_script02_1_F019, That's the wind.,3
Ses02F_script03_2_F034," Turn it on again, please.",3
Ses03M_script03_1_M038, The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,3
Ses04M_script02_2_F011," No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.  I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",3
Ses04F_impro05_F012, I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.,3
Ses04F_script01_3_F028, that includes me.  And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.,3
Ses03M_script01_1_F013, How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,3
Ses02M_script01_2_M015," Wait, why my above all?",3
Ses01M_script03_2_M025, Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,3
Ses01F_script03_2_F009, No.  Thank you.,3
Ses05F_script01_1_M034," I've been a good son for too long, a big sucker.  I'm through with it.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_M045, I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--,3
Ses01M_impro05_M031, Thank you very much.,3
Ses05F_impro05_F028, Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.,3
Ses03F_impro08_M011, I- I'm going to kill myself right now.,3
Ses01M_impro05_M026, It'll be a lot more than what you're doing sitting here and just give me lip service.  I'd like to go back at least do some aggressive searching for my stuff.,3
Ses01M_script01_1_F028," The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",3
Ses02F_script01_1_F040," Well, you don't want to think like that.",3
Ses01M_script03_2_F035, Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,3
Ses03M_impro05a_M026," You're the manager? You don't know where you work for, you don't know where you're at and you're the manager?",3
Ses03F_script03_2_M031," Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.",3
Ses01F_script02_2_F005," I'm sorry, it's just fish to me.",3
Ses02M_script03_2_M034, Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.,3
Ses02F_script03_2_F015," No, just making myself fascinating for you.",3
Ses01F_script03_2_F010," I don't know why you'd want any, you've already had three glasses.",3
Ses05F_script03_2_F024," Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_F005," Well, what of it?",3
Ses04F_impro05_F013, I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-,3
Ses03F_script02_2_F005," Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.",3
Ses03M_script03_2_F021, ...cause really,3
Ses04M_script03_2_F044," Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.",3
Ses01F_script01_2_F005," What is going on here, Joe?",3
Ses04F_script01_3_F027," Because you mustn't feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have, Chris, do you understand, everything",3
Ses04M_script02_1_F005, Yes.,3
Ses01M_impro05_M001," Where is my bag?  Come on, I've been here for four hours.",3
Ses03M_impro05b_M011, I'm going to San Diego tomorrow to stay with my family.  What do I need hotel lodging for hmmm?  Can you tell me that?,3
Ses04M_impro01_M024," Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.",3
Ses04F_script02_1_F014, What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,3
Ses04M_script02_2_F013," I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.",3
Ses02M_impro01_M016," But my driver's license - I had to have my birth certificate to get my driver's license in the first place right, I mean this - here is my driver's license so",3
Ses01M_script03_2_F024," Yes, I did quite a lot.",3
Ses04M_impro01_F018, So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.,3
Ses02F_script03_2_M020," Ah, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.",3
Ses04M_script01_1_F040," Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.",3
Ses02M_impro04_M006," I don't know, I mean why - why",3
Ses01M_script01_1_M021, She is not Larry's girl.,3
Ses04F_impro01_F004, I did exactly what they told me to do.,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M005, You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,3
Ses03M_impro05a_M029, My name is Brent Caption.,3
Ses03F_impro08_M008, What?  It's my phone.  You can't even call me on it. I don't have another phone.,3
Ses05M_script02_1_F002, You mean our flashlight?,3
Ses05F_script02_2_F003," Yeah, they are all told the same thing.  They are all told that you know.  Gets them excited and they can't wait and that if they just get in on the right spot, than you than maybe life will start",3
Ses03F_script01_2_F006, She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.,3
Ses02F_script03_2_M019," Yes, it is.",3
Ses05M_script02_1_F010, Not particularly.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M039," Amanda, listen.",3
Ses05M_script01_1_M011," Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",3
Ses05M_script01_1b_M026," So what, I'm not fast with women?",3
Ses05M_script03_2_M000, Come to think of it the real cause of that roue was Peter Burden.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_F043," Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute.",3
Ses03M_script03_2_M030," Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.",3
Ses02M_script03_2_F036, Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.,3
Ses03M_script01_1_F044, Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't.,3
Ses04M_script01_2_F000, Why did he invite her here?,3
Ses03M_script01_1_F017, Why?,3
Ses03F_script03_1_M006," Hello? Hello? What? Ugh, wrong number.",3
Ses04F_impro02_M022, Yes- You don't have to go.  What are they going to do?  Huh?  Put a gun to your head?,3
Ses03M_script01_2_M007, You can't read her mind.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M020, It's a pity you don't have anymore brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,3
Ses03M_impro08a_F028," No, no, no.  I didn't choose to live here.  I work there.  Okay?  Yeah. work work work",3
Ses01M_script03_2_F014, Do be quiet.,3
Ses01M_script03_2_M036, Turn it off. It's driving me mad.,3
Ses02M_script01_1_M039," Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",3
Ses03F_script03_2_M003, You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3
Ses04F_impro04_F019, Well yeah I mean I like take a shower and stuff.,3
Ses03M_script03_2_M001, I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,3
Ses04M_script01_1_M039, I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,3
Ses03M_script03_2_F014, What?,3
Ses02M_impro04_M019, this doesn't happen to a normal person.,3
Ses02F_script03_2_M003, You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3
Ses01F_script01_2_F012," Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.",3
Ses05F_script01_1_M039, I am thinking like that.,3
Ses03M_script02_2_M031, ...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.,3
Ses03F_impro05_F015," No, they said I couldn't lock it.",3
Ses02M_script03_2_M044, You're not.,3
Ses04M_script01_2_M008," Oh.  Now listen, kid.",3
Ses04M_script03_2_M048, Listen--,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M001, I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,3
Ses03M_script01_1_M039, I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M003, You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3
Ses05F_script03_2_F040," Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous.",3
Ses01M_script02_2_F003, It's a PR.,3
Ses02M_impro05_M016," Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-",3
Ses05F_impro01_M012," I am a very compassionate person, and I'm offended that you imply that I'm not.  Of course, I'm compassionate.  Look, I work in the D.M.V..  What do you think I am?  Go wait in line two A.",3
Ses02F_script02_1_F022, It's ridiculous.,3
Ses02M_script03_2_F017," watch me a minute, will you?",3
Ses04F_impro05_F001, Yeah.  Yeah I did.,3
Ses04M_script01_1_M037, The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,3
Ses02F_impro01_M024, I am the supervisor.  So--,3
Ses01F_script03_2_F023, Mind your own business.,3
Ses04F_script01_2_F000, Why did he invite her?,3
Ses01F_script03_2_M030, Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.,3
Ses02M_script03_2_F020, It doesn't seem to work such wonders with you.,3
Ses01F_script03_2_F007," If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_M023, They snap.,3
Ses05M_script01_2_F011," No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me!",3
Ses04F_script03_2_F039," Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",3
Ses02M_impro05_M014, see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like-,3
Ses03F_script02_2_F010," No, we won't.",3
Ses04F_script03_2_M027, I'm not in the least drunk.,3
Ses05F_script01_1_F011," What are you going to do, argue with him?",3
Ses05M_impro04_M027, Thank you.  Ha ha.,3
Ses02M_script01_2_F002, Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,3
Ses03M_impro01_M014," Hey, no, give me that back.",3
Ses04F_impro05_F019," Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate.",3
Ses01M_script03_2_F031, Why?,3
Ses01F_script01_2_F004, It's got that about it.,3
Ses01M_impro01_M023, If it makes you stop acting like a child.,3
Ses01F_script02_1_M022," No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?",3
Ses05M_script01_1_F014," The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.",3
Ses05M_script01_1b_M036," Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.",3
Ses04M_script03_2_F033," On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",3
Ses04M_script03_2_F017, It's become a habit with you.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_F041, finally and forever,3
Ses01M_script01_2_F009," I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",3
Ses02F_script01_1_F013, Can you prove it?  How can you prove it?,3
Ses02M_script01_1_F011, You can't say that to him.,3
Ses04F_impro04_F010, Okay that's helpful.  Thanks.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_F046, Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.,3
Ses04M_script02_2_F005," Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.",3
Ses02F_script02_2_F004," Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.",3
Ses04F_impro04_F023," Uhuh. Uhuh. Yeah, yeah. Good quote.",3
Ses01M_impro05_M003," Yes, Georgia.  Good for you I need my bag.  Can you...",3
Ses03F_script02_2_F034, This what? What is this? This is nothing.,3
Ses04F_impro05_F015, No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.,3
Ses03M_script02_1_F021, About what?,3
Ses04M_script01_2_F010," Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.",3
Ses04F_impro05_F010," Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.",3
Ses02M_script03_2_M035, There are people downstairs I suppose?,3
Ses04M_script01_1_M025, To hell with that.,3
Ses04F_impro01_F012, I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.,3
Ses01M_script01_2_F013, You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.,3
Ses03M_impro05b_M021, Are you kidding me?,3
Ses01F_script03_2_F019, It's funny it hasn't worked such wonders for you.,3
Ses01M_script03_2_M010, That's a nice point of view I must say.,3
Ses05F_script01_2_F002, Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,3
Ses05M_script03_2_F037," You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.",3
Ses04F_script02_2_F010, We never do.  Do we have we ever?,3
Ses04M_script03_2_M020," Really, Amanda",3
Ses04F_script01_3_M037, There was no meaning in it here.,3
Ses05F_impro01_M024, Thank you very much.  You have a wonderful day.,3
Ses05M_script02_1_F003," I mean, you kept saying my flashlight, the flashlight like it was only somehow yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?",3
Ses03M_script03_2_M029, I'm not in the least bit drunk.,3
Ses03M_script03_2_M016, Nothing.,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M038, Turn it off.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_F001, Presents? It was only a small trivial little broach.,3
Ses04F_script02_2_M002, It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,3
Ses01M_script02_1_F016," I just don't, it's stupid.",3
Ses05F_impro05_F041," No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_M022," Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!",3
Ses01F_impro04_F021," That's baloney, that's baloney.",3
Ses04M_impro02_M035," Well I guess we're at a stalemate then, aren't we?",3
Ses04F_script01_1_F039, Well you don't want to think that way.,3
Ses01M_script01_1_F041," Well, you don't think like that.",3
Ses05F_script03_2_M025, I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.,3
Ses03M_impro04_M013, Why all these questions?,3
Ses02F_script01_1_F023," From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl.",3
Ses01M_script01_2_F004," What is going on here, Joe?",3
Ses01F_script02_1_F006, You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.,3
Ses03M_script01_1_M009, You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_F014, What?,3
Ses02M_script01_1_F029," I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead.",3
Ses02F_script02_2_M032," 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",3
Ses04M_script02_1_F012, I just don't.  It's stupid.,3
Ses02M_script03_2_F028, Oh be quiet.,3
Ses01M_script01_1_F020," Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business.",3
Ses04F_script02_2_M010, Why not?,3
Ses03M_impro08a_F011, I want a camera phone actually.,3
Ses01M_impro04_M000, I'm just mad.,3
Ses05M_script01_1_F028," Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_F014, What?,3
Ses03M_impro08a_F032," In fact, give me your name sir, what's your name again?",3
Ses02F_impro05_F019, It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me.,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M017," As a matter of fact, that is perfectly true.",3
Ses04M_script01_1_M033, I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if,3
Ses01M_impro04_M008," No, well maybe it's because I'm like frustrated 'cause I can't get a job, you know.",3
Ses04F_script01_2_F009, Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.,3
Ses01M_script02_2_F018," I did want to see it I still do, I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it just never is.",3
Ses03M_impro05b_M031, Some peanuts?  Wow.  That helps a lot.,3
Ses01F_impro04_F031, Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.,3

Ses01M_impro01_F014, Hi.   You know...,3
Ses05M_script01_2_M016," What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you?",3
Ses02F_script03_2_M036, I'll do no such thing.,3
Ses03M_impro04_M016," To be a lawyer?  You go to law school now?  God this is, all these dead ends.",3
Ses04F_impro01_M022, Ma'am you are testing my patience.  Do you understand me?,3
Ses05F_script02_2_M025, What.  Welcome to the human race.,3
Ses05M_script01_1_F027," Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.",3
Ses05M_script01_1b_M017, So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?,3
Ses05F_script03_2_F007," Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious, you never would have heard about it.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_M014, You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment.,3
Ses02M_script03_2_F042, You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_F042," Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.",3
Ses05M_script01_1_M023, She is not Larry's girl!,3
Ses05M_script03_2_F014, What?,3
Ses03M_script03_2_M043, You're not going nowhere. No you're not.,3
Ses02F_script03_2_F026, I expect it's because you're drunk.,3
Ses05M_script02_2_F005," God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.",3
Ses04F_impro04_M034, I'm trying to watch TV. TV.,3
Ses03M_script03_2_F022, it doesn't seem to be working on you.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_F031, Why?,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M004," You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",3
Ses02M_script03_2_M023, They snap.,3
Ses01F_script03_2_F035," You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.",3
Ses04F_script01_3_M004, What?,3
Ses04M_script03_2_F019, What?,3
Ses04F_impro01_F016, This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.,3
Ses01M_impro01_F003, That's just strange I figured you filled in wrong sections.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_M033," I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?",3

Ses02M_script03_2_M014," Really, Amanda.",3
Ses04M_impro02_F022, Well it doesn't seem like you're that bothered by it.,3
Ses02M_script03_2_F027, On the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of Brandy.,3
Ses01M_script03_2_F033, They are away in Tunis.,3
Ses04F_script02_2_M016, I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.,3
Ses04F_script01_1_F038, You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?,3
Ses03F_impro08_M022," So, you're going to give me back ten dollars worth of minutes--",3
Ses03F_script02_2_M030," You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this.",3
Ses05M_script02_2_F003," Sure.  Everybody is told the same thing, it keeps us all excited.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start now any minute if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.",3
Ses04F_script03_2_M034, There are people downstairs I suppose.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_F038," Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",3
Ses04F_impro01_M021, like I said before right now.,3
Ses04F_impro08_M018, You're going to fill out a form on your desk,3
Ses01M_impro01_M020, Did you even look at the form?  I filled it out all these questions--,3
Ses01F_impro04_F012, No.,3
Ses04F_script03_2_M045," You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.",3
Ses04M_script03_2_M031, They snap.,3
Ses04M_impro02_F014, This is supposed to be a partnership.  We're supposed to do this together. I'm not supposed to be left here to do this by myself while you leave.,3
Ses02M_script02_1_F007, It's after eleven. Let's just go home.,3
Ses02M_script03_2_M037, I'll do no such thing.,3
Ses02F_impro01_F020, With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_F021," Adders don't snap, they sting.",3
Ses04F_impro01_M025, I've walked away already.  I'm not here anymore.,3
Ses01M_script03_2_M019, That reply has broken my heart.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_M021, It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,3
Ses01F_script03_2_M022, Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_M019," As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",3
Ses02F_script01_1_F022, I ignore what I gotta ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,3
Ses01F_script02_1_F005, It's ours; it's my flashlight too.,3
Ses01M_impro04_M014, What?,3
Ses05F_script02_2_F008, We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.,3
Ses01F_script01_2_F009," Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",3
Ses05M_script01_1b_F016," What do you want me to do?  I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind.",3
Ses05F_script01_1_F038," All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!",3
Ses01M_script03_2_F013," I just, I just think it's becoming a habit with you.",3
Ses02F_script03_2_F039," I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",3
Ses02M_script03_2_F025, Mind your own business.,3
Ses02F_script02_1_F013," Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die.",3
Ses04F_script03_2_F037, Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.,3
Ses01M_script01_1_F007, What is he doing out here at that hour?,3
Ses03M_script01_2_F007," Then why is still single?  I mean there's plenty of single men in New York.  Why isn't she married by now?  Probably a hundred men has told her that she's foolish but, she's waiting.",3
Ses04F_script03_2_M016," Going somewhere, my dear?",3
Ses04M_script02_2_F010, Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.,3
Ses04M_script02_2_M032," Yes, it is.",3
Ses03M_script03_2_F029, You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,3
Ses05M_script03_2_M009," Me, too, bored stiff.",3
Ses02M_script03_2_F018," Oh, no it isn't.",3
Ses05M_script03_2_F032, They're away in Tunis.,3
Ses04M_impro02_F025," It's a free world.  I can go where I want.  Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go.",3
Ses02F_script02_2_F013, I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.,3
Ses03F_script03_2_F040, This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.,3
Ses04M_script03_2_M050, wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.,3

Ses03F_impro08_M006, You know what?  I'm just going to- Patient?  I'm a busy man.,3
Ses04F_script01_2_F010, Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.,3
Ses02M_script03_2_F041," Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment.",3
Ses01M_script01_1_F022, I'm just saying.,3
Ses05F_script01_1_F013," How are you going to prove it, I mean, there's no body and there's no grave.  So what are you going to do? Do you have proof?",3
Ses02F_script03_2_F008, I'm bored with this conversation.,3
Ses01M_script03_2_F036, I won't.,3
Ses03M_impro08b_F006, No I did not drop my phone in water.  I'm not five years old and just dropped my phone anywhere I see it.  Okay this is my business.,3
Ses05M_impro01_M011, Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form?,3
Ses05F_script03_2_M033, It's very late and it will disturb the people upstairs.,3

Ses03F_script01_2_F004, It's got that about it.,3
Ses04M_script02_2_M029," Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.",3
Ses01M_impro01_F025, They don't pay me enough to deal people like you.,3
Ses04F_script03_1_M015, flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,3
Ses01M_script02_1_M028, People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.,3
Ses03M_impro04_M019, Yeah.  I know.  You'd think I would be able to be C.E.O. of a company right?,3
Ses02F_script03_2_M046, I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees,3
Ses05F_impro04_F008, I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.,3

Ses04F_script02_2_F036," This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot in everything but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",4
Ses04F_script02_2_F040, Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else,4
Ses04F_script02_2_M001, What I said.,4
Ses04F_script02_2_M006, Well then what's bugging you?,4
Ses04F_script02_2_M013, I thought you wanted to see it.,4

Ses04F_script02_2_M039, I'm doing the best I can.,4
Ses04F_script03_2_F008," Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.",4
Ses04F_script03_2_M012, You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.,4
Ses04F_script03_2_M028, I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.,4
Ses04M_impro08_F000, Hi.  I've been on the phone for an hour trying to get a little discrepancy on my bill fixed.  I was charged for two hundred dollars worth of calls that I didn't make.,4

Ses04M_impro08_F014," but, at the same time, I have been through an hour of little robot voices telling me what I needed to do.",4
Ses04M_impro08_F015, And I did everything they said.  And now i'm talking to you and you're supposed to put the money back on my account because I didn't make the calls and I'm really tired of dealing with this because I didn't even,4

Ses04M_impro01_F014," And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need.",4
Ses04M_impro01_F015, I can't do that. It's against our rules. You can go get in that line over there or you can just go ahead and leave and come back another day.  Maybe there will be a shorter line.,4
Ses04M_impro01_F016, I can't do that.,4
Ses04M_impro01_F020, The one you just came from.,4

Ses04M_impro01_M008, or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot.,4

Ses04F_script01_1_M016, You know why.,4

Ses04M_impro05_F030, And your bag is not my concern.,4
Ses04M_impro05_F033, You can go ahead and go fill out the form. We'll look for your bag.,4

Ses04M_impro05_M000," Yeah, hi.  Look--Um, okay.  Here's the thing.",4
Ses04M_impro05_M001, Just arrived from London--,4
Ses04M_impro05_M002, lost my luggage. Your airline--,4
Ses04M_impro05_M003," lost my luggage. I didn't lose it. No, it's not like I left it somewhere and somebody took it.",4
Ses04M_impro05_M004," It was lost.  I waited on the conveyor -- near the conveyor belt to see, you know, where -- then the baggage claim and see if it would- it would come out.",4
Ses04M_impro05_M005," Didn't come out.  I spoke to somebody, a local authority figure.",4
Ses04M_impro05_M006," And he told me to come to this desk here so I can, uh, at least get, uh, the hundred- hundred and fifty dollars that- that I'm owed for my loss.",4
Ses04M_impro05_M007, 'Cause that's roughly how much the bag plus all its contents was worth.,4
Ses04M_impro05_M012," What I want you to do is I want you to write three of those, as if I were three people.  Okay.  You can write -- you can just put my name on all --",4
Ses04M_impro05_M013, But what I'm telling you is that's what you're going to do.,4

Ses04M_impro05_M021," You don't understand. You don't understand, actually.  You don't understand because it was my luggage that was lost.  Okay.",4
Ses04M_impro05_M023," No, it's not going to be -- but it's not going to be fifty, it's going to be a hundred and fifty.  You're going to write three, you understand, three of- of the forms.  You're going to write three of them out and then give it to me.",4
Ses04M_impro05_M024, You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me.  You're going to do that.,4
Ses04M_impro05_M025," Look, can I just -- can I speak to your manager, please?  'Cause I- I really -- I don't, um -- I mean, I just don't want to deal with -- I know that -- I mean, I know this isn't your fault,",4
Ses04M_impro05_M027," But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me--",4
Ses04M_impro05_M028, But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person,4
Ses04M_impro05_M029, then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see?,4
Ses04M_impro05_M030, But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage.,4
Ses04M_impro05_M031," Look, I don't -- look, can we just not argue about this.  Like--",4
Ses04M_impro05_M032, So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms,4
Ses04M_impro05_M033, with different names on them? That-,4
Ses04M_impro05_M034," but, no. See, 'cause",4
Ses04M_impro05_M035, if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty.,4
Ses04M_impro05_M036," Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but",4
Ses04M_impro05_M037," um, you know, I -- this is my bag and I need the hundred and fifty dollars. Please.",4
Ses04M_impro05_M040," Just all I need you to do is just fill out three forms and I'll leave you alone forever, forever.  I'll never -- we'll never see each other again.",4
Ses04M_impro05_M041, But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again.,4
Ses04M_impro05_M042, But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks.,4
Ses04M_impro05_M043, I don't -- I'm not- I'm not convinced.,4
Ses04M_impro05_M045," So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?",4
Ses04M_script01_1_F024, Now what can I do for you?,4
Ses04M_script01_1_M007," I don't know the meaning of it, mom.  But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad.",4
Ses04M_script01_1_M010, I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore.,4

Ses04M_script01_1_M029, Because it is.,4
Ses04M_script01_1_M042, I know that.  Just you help me stay here.,4

Ses01M_impro04_F023, [BREATHING],4
Ses01M_impro04_F024, That's -.,4
Ses01M_impro04_M001, It's--I've been trying to find this job I can't get any job.,4
Ses01M_impro04_M002, It's not fair.,4
Ses01M_impro04_M003," I mean I've been looking for a job for like three years and I can't get a job.  I mean like, it's America, right?  I should be able to get a job.",4
Ses01M_impro04_M004," I guess.  But three years?  I mean, I like--I went to college even, I mean I didn't finish but I went for like a little bit.  It's not fair, I don't know.",4
Ses01M_impro04_M005," I mean I've been sending out my resumes and doing everything I can do but nothing is happening.  You know, it's like I can't and I can't keep living on loans anymore like this.  I'm going to--I mean eventually I'm going to have to pay it back. I'm just kind of freaking out, I don't know.",4
Ses01M_impro04_M009," Like it's really hard to like shake that off when you go into like audition a room or whatever, you know what I mean?",4
Ses01M_impro04_M010," I guess I just getting really hard to fake, you know.",4
Ses01M_impro04_M012, Yeah.,4
Ses01M_impro04_M019," Well, it's 'cause I can't get a job, okay?",4
Ses01M_impro04_M020, I'm not always right I'm just--,4
Ses01M_script01_1_F019," Well, that's only your business, Chris.",4
Ses01M_script01_1_M008, I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.,4
Ses01M_script01_1_M010," I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back?",4
Ses01M_script01_1_M011," I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more.",4
Ses01M_script01_1_M012, I got to.,4
Ses01M_script01_1_M013," For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.",4
Ses01M_script01_1_M014," Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",4
Ses01M_script01_1_M019, So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?,4
Ses01M_script01_1_M022, I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life...,4
Ses01M_script01_1_M027, Because it is.,4
Ses01M_script01_1_M028," I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife.",4
Ses01M_script01_1_M030, I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.,4
Ses01M_script01_1_M031," When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else.",4
Ses01F_impro04_F002," I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board.",4
Ses01F_impro04_F007, Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre.,4
Ses01F_impro04_F016, I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at.,4
Ses01F_impro04_F020, ..I just-..I just think it's kind of prejudiced and they are really discriminating against people who just aren't that way.,4
Ses01F_impro04_M017," No.  But it has an outline, you know.",4
Ses01F_impro04_M020," Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.",4
Ses01F_impro04_M029," You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because...",4
Ses01F_impro04_M030, ...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume.,4
Ses01F_impro04_M034, What? Oh.  So now you're...,4
Ses01F_impro04_M035, you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me.,4
Ses01F_impro01_F007, How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place?,4
Ses01F_impro01_F008, I'm here to get an ID.,4
Ses01F_impro01_F009, Like what?  Like a birth certificate?,4
Ses01F_impro01_F010, Who the hell has a birth certificate?,4
Ses01F_impro01_F011," Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here?",4
Ses01F_impro01_F013, How long have you been working here?,4
Ses01F_impro01_F015, That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah.,4
Ses01F_impro01_M000, Do you have your forms?,4
Ses01F_impro01_M001, Let me see them.,4
Ses01F_impro01_M003, Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form.,4
Ses01F_impro01_M004, This form is a Z.X.four.,4
Ses01F_impro01_M005," You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID.",4
Ses01F_impro01_M006, No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you.,4
Ses01F_impro01_M007, I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID.,4
Ses01F_impro01_M008," No.  I need another ID, a separate one.",4
Ses01F_impro01_M009," A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything?",4
Ses01F_impro01_M010," Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file.",4
Ses01F_impro01_M012, Actually too long.,4
Ses01F_script02_1_F001, [BREATHING],4
Ses01F_script02_1_F008, Yeah.,4
Ses01F_script02_1_F018, I don't see why you're so excited; this isn't a freaking moon landing we are talking about.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.,4
Ses01F_script02_1_F019, Oh Augie,4
Ses01F_script02_1_F020, I'm just not.,4

Ses01M_impro01_F010, You have a birth certificate?,4
Ses01M_impro01_F015, I am..I don't..I don't understand what you want.  A driver's license or a California ID.,4
Ses01M_impro01_M000," Yes, me. Okay, okay here we go.",4
Ses01M_impro01_M001," Okay, so filled out all these forms  --",4
Ses01M_impro01_M002, and I have This form of ID here so...,4
Ses01M_impro01_M005, I'm just applying for another ID.,4

Ses01M_impro01_M007," I have it right here, yes.",4
Ses01M_impro01_M008, But that's...,4
Ses01M_impro01_M009," That's why I'm here, that's why I was waiting in this line.  I need to get another form of ID.",4
Ses01M_impro01_M011," I don't where it is though, I don't have with me.  Can I get it from somewhere?  I mean...",4
Ses01M_impro01_M012, I probably have to go wait another line to get my birth certificate don't I?,4
Ses01M_impro01_M016, Okay. [BREATHING],4
Ses01M_impro01_M017, I need California ID.,4
Ses01M_impro01_M018, On top of these other two forms of ID which I already have.,4
Ses01M_impro01_M019," No, I don't have driver's license.",4
Ses01M_impro01_M021, Did you even look at the form?  I've already answered these question.,4
Ses01M_impro01_M022, Okay.,4
Ses01M_impro01_M026," Okay, okay let's keep our voices down, okay?  I didn't come here to get in yelling match.",4
Ses01M_impro01_M027," I did not come in here to get in a yelling match with you, all right?",4
Ses01M_impro01_M028, Just try and help me.,4
Ses01M_script03_2_F009, I'm bored with this conversation.,4
Ses01M_script03_2_M011, So am I.  I'm bored stiff.  You want some brandy?,4
Ses01M_script02_2_F012," Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come.",4
Ses01M_script02_2_F028, No.,4
Ses01M_script02_2_F029, No.,4
Ses01M_script02_2_M010," Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish.",4
Ses01M_script02_2_M034," Well, welcome to the human race.",4
Ses01M_script01_2_M005," Okay, now listen, kids...",4
Ses01M_script01_2_M008," Okay, look it's a beautiful day.  Why are we arguing?",4
Ses01M_script01_2_M009, What do you want me to do?  What do you want?,4
Ses01M_script01_2_M010, Kate...,4

Ses01M_script01_2_M014, calm yourself.,4
Ses01M_impro02_F006, [BREATHING],4
Ses01M_impro02_F008, [BREATHING],4
Ses01M_impro05_F008, I'm not a child.,4
Ses01M_impro05_F009, I've been here for sixteen.,4
Ses01M_impro05_F010, I come here every single day.,4
Ses01M_impro05_F035, You know I don't need to take this sort of abuse.,4
Ses01M_impro05_F036, That's fantastic.,4
Ses01M_impro05_F037, Then why don't you take your fifty dollars. Get yourself a taxi and go shopping tomorrow.,4
Ses01M_impro05_M000," Yes, please help me.  Where is my bag?",4
Ses01M_impro05_M002," Okay, I'm coming in from Atlanta.",4
Ses01M_impro05_M009, My bag from Atlanta.,4
Ses01M_impro05_M010, It's a little black bag with wheels.,4
Ses01M_impro05_M014," Just had a really, really stressful day, okay?  And I need my bag; can you please help me get my bag?",4
Ses01M_impro05_M018, Where is it?  Where did it go?,4
Ses01M_impro05_M030, [BREATHING],4
Ses01F_script01_2_M003, [BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.,4
Ses01F_script01_2_M009," Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing?",4
Ses01F_script01_2_M010, What do you want me to do? What do you want?,4
Ses01F_script01_2_M011, Kate.,4
Ses01F_script01_2_M012, [BREATHING],4
Ses01F_script01_2_M013, Calm yourself.,4
Ses01F_script01_2_M014, Okay. Calm yourself.,4
Ses01F_script01_2_M015," I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all?",4
Ses01F_script01_2_M016," Look at you, you're shaking.",4
Ses01F_script03_2_F008, Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.,4
Ses01F_script03_2_M005," Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did.",4
Ses01F_script03_2_M009, So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy?,4
Ses01F_script03_2_M012," You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on.",4
Ses01F_script03_2_M013, Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.,4
Ses01F_script03_2_M015, Nothing.,4
Ses01F_script03_2_M033," Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad.",4
Ses01F_script02_2_F000, That's the wind.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_F007, We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_F012, I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_F013, You don't understand anything I am saying.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_F014," I did want to see it, I still do, I always do.  I just...",4
Ses01F_script02_2_F021, dancing barefoot in the sand.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_F025," No, no. Nothing.",4
Ses01F_script02_2_F027, No.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_F028, I just want something to turn out like I expected it to.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_F029, [BREATHING],4
Ses01F_script02_2_F030, This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_F032," I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just...",4
Ses01F_script02_2_F033, Do you understand what I am saying?,4
Ses01F_script02_2_F039, For Heaven's sake Augie.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M003, It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M004," Not just me, look at all of these people.",4
Ses01F_script02_2_M006," Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?",4
Ses01F_script02_2_M007," Well then, what's bugging you?",4
Ses01F_script02_2_M008," There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home.",4
Ses01F_script02_2_M009, Why not?,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M010, We've missed them twice.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M011, They'll show up this time.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M012, I thought you wanted to see it.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M013, No. Of course not.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M014," It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over.",4
Ses01F_script02_2_M015, Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M019," It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.",4
Ses01F_script02_2_M020," That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right?",4
Ses01F_script02_2_M021, Sure.  All right.  Okay.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M025, Then what?,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M027, What?  What?  Do you want a divorce?,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M028, A vacation?,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M029, Like a new carpet?  A poodle?  A back rub?  Ice cream?  A suicide pact?  What do you want?  What the hell do you want?,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M031," No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get?",4
Ses01F_script02_2_M035, [BREATHING],4
Ses01F_script02_2_M036, I'm doing the best I can.,4
Ses01F_script02_2_M041," I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me.",4
Ses02M_impro05_F015, Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.,4
Ses02M_impro05_F022," I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar.",4
Ses02M_impro05_F024, The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-,4
Ses02M_impro05_F027, I'm sorry. I don't- I-,4
Ses02M_impro05_F028, I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-,4
Ses02M_impro05_F029, There's other people waiting-,4
Ses02M_impro05_M008," I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there",4
Ses02M_impro05_M020," I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay?",4
Ses02M_impro05_M021, You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage],4
Ses02M_impro05_M024," that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase.",4
Ses02M_impro05_M028, All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar.,4
Ses02M_script01_1_F019, I'm just saying,4
Ses02M_script01_1_F024, Have you asked Annie yet?,4
Ses02M_script01_1_M009, You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,4
Ses02M_script01_1_M020, So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it?,4
Ses02M_script01_1_M022, Sometimes you infuriate me you know that. Isn't it your business to if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.,4
Ses02M_script01_1_M040, I want a family; I want kids; I want something I can give myself to. Annie is in the middle of that. Now where do I find it?,4
Ses02M_script01_1_M043, I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here.,4
Ses02M_script02_1_F015, Augie,4
Ses02M_script02_1_M027, Yes they do.,4
Ses02M_script02_1_M034, We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.,4
Ses02F_impro05_F007," Yes, yes, I would like to file a claim, but what are you gonna--I mean, is it just gonna show up magically out of nowhere?",4
Ses02F_impro05_F009, Haven't you ever lost baggage?  I mean isn't there anything else you do?,4
Ses02F_impro05_F011, I didn't sign anything.,4
Ses02F_impro05_F013," [BREATHING] Well, sure, yeah, I guess I'll go buy dinner and then be--have nothing for the rest of my entire vacation.  I'm supposed to be here for three weeks.  What am I gonna do without anything for three weeks?",4
Ses02F_impro05_F014, But fifty dollars isn't going to get me anything.,4
Ses02F_impro05_F015, Isn't there anything else you can do?,4
Ses02F_impro05_F016," I mean, is there somebody you can call?  Or the guy that put the stuff on the--on the plane.  I mean, are they--they must be really irresponsible to have just disappeared my baggage.  I mean, did it get stolen?",4
Ses02F_impro05_F017," Yeah, I'm sure you -- You're like, hmm, do you take baggage?  No.  Oh, okay, thanks.  Great.  I mean how--",4
Ses02F_impro05_F018, There needs to be better security here.,4
Ses02F_impro05_F020," Well, can I at least have my fifty dollars, please?",4
Ses02F_impro05_F022, Thank you very much.,4
Ses02F_impro05_M014," No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you",4
Ses02F_impro05_M016," Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh",4
Ses02F_impro05_M018," Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--",4
Ses02M_impro02_F011, It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place.,4
Ses02M_impro02_M003," It's- It's dangerous anywhere, honey. I mean this is -this- I'm just going to go and we'll get it over with,",4
Ses02F_script02_1_F007," It's after eleven, let's just go home.",4
Ses02F_script02_1_F014," What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.",4
Ses02F_script02_1_F015," Ah, Augie.",4
Ses02F_script02_1_F020, That's the wind.,4
Ses02F_script02_1_M027, Yeah they do.,4
Ses02M_script01_3_M005," The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.",4
Ses02F_script01_1_F011, What do you want to do argue with him?,4
Ses02F_script01_1_M019, So it's all right then?,4
Ses02F_script01_1_M022," Ah, sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  I mean, isn't it your business too if I tell Dad and flips--freaks out about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",4
Ses02F_script01_1_M024," I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time.",4
Ses02F_script01_1_M030," I can't help it.  I know her best.  I mean, I grew up next door to her.",4
Ses02F_script01_1_M031," These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",4
Ses02F_script01_1_M032," All right.  All right, then, Mom.",4
Ses02F_script01_1_M033, I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,4
Ses02F_script01_1_M039," I want a family.  I want kids.  I want something that I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now, where do I find it?",4
Ses02M_script01_2_F010," I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense",4
Ses02M_script01_2_M003," Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",4
Ses02M_script01_2_M008, How do you know why she has waited?,4
Ses02M_script01_2_M010, What do you want me to do about it?,4
Ses02M_script01_2_M011, But Kate,4
Ses02M_script01_2_M014, All right. All right. Calm yourself.,4
Ses02M_script01_2_M018," What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",4
Ses02M_script02_2_F001, It's ridiculous.,4

Ses02M_script02_2_F032, I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?,4
Ses02M_script02_2_M005," Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?",4
Ses02M_script02_2_M006," Well, what's bugging you?",4

Ses02F_impro01_F009, I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have.,4
Ses02F_impro01_F010," But, isn't there anything you can do.  Can't you make an exception this one time?  My picture is on both of those identifications.  It's not like you don't know that it's me.",4

Ses02F_script02_2_F001, It's ridiculous.,4
Ses02F_script02_2_F007," For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions.",4
Ses02F_script02_2_F009, Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.,4

Ses02F_script03_2_M040," Very amusing, indeed.",4
Ses02M_impro08_F002," it leads you around in circles, you can't, there is no way to like get to a real person if you don't already know how to get to there.",4
Ses02M_impro08_F003," So is there any way to like bypass that because that is so, like I've been going around in circles",4

Ses02M_impro08_F005," Okay. Oh, that would just make it so much better, 'cause I cannot handle it's just like oh, my God I can't sit here any longer and talk to this lady with this pleasant voice.",4

Ses02F_impro04_F000, I'm--every lead that I get ends up just being a dead end.  You know what I mean.  People are sick of me calling--,4
Ses02F_impro04_F001," Yeah, but it--I mean it's the same response you get over and over again.  Like--",4
Ses02F_impro04_F002," Oh, we're not hiring at this time or thank you, we already have your information on file--We'll call you when we're ready.",4
Ses02F_impro04_F003," But, it's been so long, like--I mine as well just take a job at McDonald's.  Like, I don't--",4
Ses02F_impro04_F004," I just--I can't do it anymore.  Like, it just takes it out of you--",4
Ses02F_impro04_F007," I didn't have like one of those starts, you know, like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand.",4
Ses02F_impro04_F008," It's just so frustrating.  Like, I just--I just don't wanna do it anymore.  You know?  I just don't wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time.  You know, it's just like--",4
Ses02F_impro04_F015," you have to--I mean, if you're hired by somebody, then you're not a professional, you're an amateur and that means that you're not good enough.",4
Ses02F_impro04_F017, I don't know how to get out of it.  I don't know how to dig myself out of it.  It's the same hole that I've been digging and digging and digging.  I can't--,4
Ses02F_impro04_M014," Or, well, no.  Okay. you -[GARBAGE]",4

Ses02M_impro04_M005," But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or",4
Ses02M_impro04_M007," Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.",4
Ses02M_impro04_M009," I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.",4
Ses02M_impro04_M011," I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.",4
Ses02M_impro04_M013, I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and,4
Ses02M_impro04_M016," Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.",4
Ses02M_impro04_M017, Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.,4
Ses02M_impro04_M018," I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't",4

Ses02F_impro08_M004," Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and-",4
Ses05F_impro04_F003, How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?,4
Ses05F_impro04_F004," I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.",4
Ses05F_impro04_F006, That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.,4
Ses05F_impro04_F007," I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.",4
Ses05F_impro04_F009," I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.",4
Ses05F_impro04_F010," Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?",4
Ses05F_impro04_F013, I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.,4
Ses05F_impro04_F014, Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.,4
Ses05F_impro04_F020, It's three years.,4
Ses05F_impro04_F024," Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.",4

Ses05F_impro04_F034," Yeah, I follow up.",4
Ses05F_impro04_F035, It's just like- it's a matter of-,4
Ses05F_impro04_F036," not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.",4
Ses05F_impro04_F037," I mean, anything.",4

Ses05F_impro04_M006, I,4
Ses05F_impro04_M014," I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.",4
Ses05F_impro04_M019," I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years.",4
Ses05F_impro04_M021," But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself.",4
Ses05F_impro04_M023, You can.,4
Ses05M_script01_1b_M008, I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean,4
Ses05M_script01_1b_M009," Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?",4
Ses05M_script01_1b_M010," For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!",4
Ses05M_script01_1b_M012," All right.  All right, just listen.",4
Ses05M_script01_1b_M016, You know it's not just my business.,4
Ses05M_script01_1b_M018," So it isn't just my business?  You infuriate me sometime, you know that.",4
Ses05M_script01_1b_M021," I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else, my whole bloody life, time after time, after time.",4
Ses05M_script01_1b_M027, Because it is.,4

Ses05M_script01_1b_M029," she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",4

Ses05M_impro08_F000," Hi, I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.",4
Ses05M_impro08_F001, Yeah.  That my service just goes out.,4
Ses05M_impro08_F002, yeah.,4

Ses05M_impro08_F020," what happening - So if we reset this, how will I know it's not going to happen again every other week?",4
Ses05M_impro08_F023, It's so frustrating.,4
Ses05F_impro08_M000," Oh, thank God.  Do you know how long I've been on the phone for half an hour trying to talk to a freaking human being.",4
Ses05F_impro08_M001," All I want to do is put my, pay for my freaking credit card, and there's something wrong in my bill, Like I swear, it says I didn't paid last month, but I know I paid last month.",4
Ses05F_impro08_M002," I put- I've been typing my number in millions of times, it won't listen to me, it's not working, and I can't get a single human being, and finally-",4
Ses05F_impro08_M003," you are a real human being.  Thank you very, very much.",4
Ses05F_impro08_M010," Well, when I look online, it says, it says that I was charged a late fee so I'm assuming that I paid on your web site-",4
Ses05F_impro08_M011," like I paid right through your own company before my due date but it's still and it even shows my payment there, and then it charged me the late fee afterwards.",4
Ses05F_impro08_M023," Yeah, but if I call back, I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone.",4

Ses05M_script01_1_M009, You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,4

Ses05M_impro04_M015," but Maybe they don't want to hire me because they know me. I don't know, what's wrong with me, Is there something wrong with me?",4
Ses05M_impro04_M016," I mean, You can tell me what.  Why is no one hiring me?  Is it me?  Be honest.  You can tell me. you know I can take it.  I can take it, you just tell me. Why?",4
Ses05M_impro04_M017," Yeah, but I'm -- okay, well how about personality wise?  I mean, people who know me won't hire me.  Why?",4
Ses05M_impro04_M018," I don't think I have an attitude problem when I'm on the job, no- I have an attitude problem right now because I don't have a job.",4
Ses05M_impro04_M023," I want to make some money.  I need to make some money.  I've got to pay some bills, I owe people money.  I owe lots of people money.  I need to make some money.",4
Ses05M_impro04_M024," Do you have any idea how I can make money?  I mean, what can I do to make some quick money, something?  Anything, that's relatively within the you know law.",4
Ses05M_impro04_M028, See what I mean?  You can't even think of anything.,4
Ses05M_impro04_M030, I've tried.,4
Ses05M_impro04_M031, Yes!  Nobody wants a juggler.  I am not going to -- I'm not going to dress up like a clown. I'm not going to dress up like a freaking clown. No.,4
Ses05M_impro04_M035, You and me both.,4
Ses05M_impro04_M038, I like to think so.,4
Ses05M_impro04_M039, see.,4
Ses05M_impro01_F005," Sir, don't get an attitude with me.",4
Ses05M_impro01_F007, I don't know.  I don't know who told you.  It wasn't me.,4
Ses05M_impro01_F008," You- You can ask her if you want, but she's busy and she probably won't answer you.",4
Ses05M_impro01_F010," Sir, you- I mean",4
Ses05M_impro01_F011, You can waist as much as you want,4
Ses05M_impro01_F013," I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form.",4
Ses05M_impro01_F014," Sir, please don't waste my time.",4
Ses05M_impro01_F015, There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.,4
Ses05M_impro01_F016," They're different forms, we process them all different-",4
Ses05M_impro01_F017, I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.,4
Ses05M_impro01_F019, They're processed differently.,4
Ses05M_impro01_F022, But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times.,4
Ses05M_impro01_M003, What's wrong about this form?  It says new I.D. on it.,4
Ses05M_impro01_M004, What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?,4
Ses05M_impro01_M006, yeah.,4
Ses05M_impro01_M007, right.,4
Ses05M_impro01_M008," Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?",4
Ses05M_impro01_M009," Well, it was this girl standing right next to you.  Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form?",4
Ses05M_impro01_M012, Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.,4
Ses05M_impro01_M013, Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?,4
Ses05M_impro01_M014," Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?",4
Ses05F_script01_1_M010," No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.",4
Ses05F_script01_1_M015," All right, All right mom.  Listen!",4
Ses05F_script01_1_M017, You know.,4
Ses05F_script01_1_M019, You know that's not just my business.,4
Ses05F_script01_1_M020, So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?,4
Ses05F_script01_1_M021, Then it's not only my business.  Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?,4
Ses05F_script01_1_M024," I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.",4
Ses05F_script01_1_M029, Because it is.,4
Ses05F_script01_1_M030," I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?",4
Ses05F_script01_1_M032," I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.",4
Ses05F_script02_1_F010, So let's go.,4
Ses05F_impro01_F001," Okay, I'm sorry, but I just stood in this line for an hour.  can I Is there any way I can-",4

Ses05F_impro01_F011," I don't have time for this today, and-",4
Ses05F_impro01_F013," Please, I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand, and they told me here.",4
Ses05F_impro01_M004," Simply step to line two A, ma'am, I'm sorry.",4
Ses05F_impro01_M005, There is a large line of people behind you waiting to be--,4
Ses05F_impro01_M006," I don't want to be rude here, ma'am, but line two B is where you need to be.  This is the line for registration.",4
Ses05F_impro01_M007, I don't have those-,4
Ses05F_impro01_M008," I don't have those forms, ma'am.  I can't help you.  That's why you need to go to line two A.",4
Ses05F_impro01_M009," Ma'am, obviously I have no idea how long it's taking.  There seems to be a bit of a line there.  It looks like thirty forty people.  It could take four to five hours.  I'm sorry.",4
Ses05F_impro01_M010," There's nothing I can do for you, ma'am.",4
Ses05F_impro01_M011," But, obviously I don't have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line.  There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things.",4
Ses05F_impro01_M014," what, no, I'm sure they did not tell you here.",4
Ses05F_impro01_M017," I'm not saying that you're stupid, ma'am.  I think you just said that you were stupid.",4
Ses05F_impro01_M018," It doesn't work that way here, ma'am.",4
Ses05F_impro01_M019, There is a strict system here.  You need to wait in the right line for the right thing.  This is the line for registration.,4
Ses05F_impro01_M020, I told you it was line two A.,4
Ses05F_impro01_M021, I don't know who told you that but they were wrong.  I'm sorry.,4
Ses05F_impro01_M023," I'm being very straight with you, ma'am.  There is nothing I can do for you.  You need to stand in line two A.",4
Ses05M_script01_3_M037," It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,",4

Ses05M_script02_2_M006, What's bugging you then?,4
Ses05M_script02_2_M011," Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.",4
Ses05M_script02_2_M013," I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --",4
Ses05M_script02_2_M014," you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.

Ses05F_script02_2_M026," You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I propose I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road, we will end up on a beach arguing over fish. You think that I knew that there would be times when you will look at me like I am used Kleenex?  Or that I will look at you and think, holy hell what's the next flight to Alaska.",4
Ses05F_script02_2_M027," No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.",4

Ses05F_impro05_M009," Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?",4
Ses05F_impro05_M010," Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?",4
Ses05F_impro05_M011, And you couldn't find it?,4

Ses05F_impro05_M020, Obviously ma'am.,4
Ses05F_impro05_M021," I am sorry, ma'am.",4
Ses05F_impro05_M024," Well, if I knew that, then I'd know where it was, wouldn't I?",4
Ses05F_impro05_M026, That's what the cost of the ticket was for.,4
Ses05F_impro05_M027," Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-",4
Ses05F_impro05_M028," Right. Yes, ma'am.",4
Ses05F_impro05_M029," Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.",4
Ses05F_impro05_M035," Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.",4
Ses05F_impro05_M036," I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.",4
Ses05F_impro05_M038," Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.",4

Ses05F_impro05_M041," The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.",4
Ses05F_impro05_M042, I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here.,4
Ses05F_impro05_M043," Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.",4
Ses05F_impro05_M044," I have no guarantee, absolutely not.",4
Ses05F_impro05_M045, How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?,4
Ses05F_impro05_M046," Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?",4
Ses05F_impro05_M047," Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous",4
Ses05F_impro05_M049," I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.",4
Ses05F_impro05_M050," And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.",4
